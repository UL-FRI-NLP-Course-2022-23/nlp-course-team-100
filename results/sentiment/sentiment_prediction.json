                "Now her weird hoo-hoo-hoo-oo-oo echoes through the quiet wood, and she begins her hunt for the bugs and beetles, frogs and mice she likes so well to eat.",
                "Now there was a certain old Owl who had become very cross and hard to please as she grew older, especially if anything disturbed her daily slumbers.",
                "One warm summer afternoon as she dozed away in her den in the old oak tree, a Grasshopper nearby began a joyous but very raspy song.",
                "Out popped the old Owl's head from the opening in the tree that served her both for door and for window.",
                "Get away from here, sir, she said to the Grasshopper.",
                "Have you no manners?, You should at least respect my age and leave me to sleep in quiet!",
                "But the Grasshopper answered saucily that he had as much right to his place in the sun as the Owl had to her place in the old oak.",
                "Then he struck up a louder and still more rasping tune.",
                "The wise old Owl knew quite well that it would do no good to argue with the Grasshopper, nor with anybody else for that matter.",
                "Besides, her eyes were not sharp enough by day to permit her to punish the Grasshopper as he deserved.",
                "So she laid aside all hard words and spoke very kindly to him.",
                "Well sir, she said, if I must stay awake, I am going to settle right down to enjoy your singing.",
                "Now that I think of it, I have a wonderful wine here, sent me from Olympus, of which I am told Apollo drinks before he sings to the high gods.",

Then after sundown, when the rosy light fades from the sky and the shadows rise slowly through the wood, out The Owl comes ruffling and blinking from the old hollow tree. Now The Owl weird hoo-hoo-hoo-oo-oo echoes through the wood, and The Owl begins The Owl hunt for the bugs and beetles, frogs and mice The Owl likes so well to eat. Now there was a certain old Owl who had become very cross and hard to please as The Owl grew older, especially if anything disturbed The Owl daily slumbers. One warm summer afternoon as The Owl dozed away in The Owl den in the old oak tree, a Grasshopper nearby began a joyous but very raspy song. Out popped the old Owl's head from the opening in the tree that served The Owl both for door and for window. Get away from here, sir, The Owl said to a Grasshopper. Have you no manners?, You should at least respect my age and leave me to sleep in quiet! But a Grasshopper a Grasshopper answered saucily that a Grasshopper had as much right to a Grasshopper place in the sun as the Owl had to Owl place in the old oak. Then a Grasshopper struck up a louder and still more rasping tune. the Owl knew quite well that the Owl would do no good to argue with a Grasshopper, nor with anybody else for that matter. Besides, Owl eyes were not sharp enough by day to permit Owl to punish a Grasshopper as the Owl deserved. So Owl laid aside all hard words and spoke very kindly to the Owl. Well sir, Owl said, if I must stay awake, I am going to settle right down to enjoy your singing. Now that I think of it, I have a wonderful wine here, sent me from Olympus, of which I am told Apollo drinks before Apollo sings to the high gods. Please come up and taste this delicious drink with sir. I know it will make you sing like Apollo. a Grasshopper a Grasshopper was taken in by the Owl's flattering words. Up a Grasshopper jumped to the Owl's den, but as soon as a Grasshopper was near enough so the Owl could see a Grasshopper clearly, Owl pounced upon a Grasshopper and ate a Grasshopper up."

These, Juno, whose favorite The Peacock was, granted to The Peacock one day when The Peacock begged her for a train of feathers to distinguish The Peacock from the other birds. Then, decked in The Peacock finery, gleaming with emerald, gold, purple, and azure, The Peacock strutted proudly among the other birds. All regarded The Peacock with envy. Even the most beautiful pheasant could see that The Peacock beauty was surpassed. Presently The Peacock saw an Eagle soaring high up in the blue sky and felt a desire to fly, as The Peacock had been accustomed to do. Lifting The Peacock wings The Peacock tried to rise from the ground. But the weight of The Peacock magnificent train held The Peacock down. Instead of flying up to greet the first rays of the morning sun or to bathe in the rosy light among the floating clouds at sunset, The Peacock would have to walk the ground more encumbered and oppressed than any common barnyard fowl."

All this an Ass whose Master also owned a Lap Dog an Ass whose Master also owned a Lap Dog saw with much discontent. Though an Ass whose Master also owned a Lap Dog was well fed, an Ass whose Master also owned a Lap Dog had much work to do; besides, whose Master hardly ever took any notice of an Ass whose Master also owned a Lap Dog. Now an Ass whose Master also owned a Lap Dog an Ass whose Master also owned a Lap Dog got it into an Ass whose Master also owned a Lap Dog silly head that all an Ass whose Master also owned a Lap Dog had to do to win whose Masterwhose Master's favor was to act like an Ass whose Master also owned a Lap Dog. So one day an Ass whose Master also owned a Lap Dog left an Ass whose Master also owned a Lap Dog stable and clattered eagerly into the house. Finding whose Master seated at the dinner table, an Ass whose Master also owned a Lap Dog kicked up an Ass whose Master also owned a Lap Dog heels and, with a loud bray, pranced giddily around the dinner table, upsetting his heels as an Ass whose Master also owned a Lap Dog did so. Then an Ass whose Master also owned a Lap Dog planted an Ass whose Master also owned a Lap Dog forefeet on whose Master's knees and rolled out an Ass whose Master also owned a Lap Dog tongue to lick whose Master's face, as an Ass whose Master also owned a Lap Dog had seen an Ass whose Master also owned a Lap Dog do. But an Ass whose Master also owned a Lap Dog weight upset the chair, and Ass and man rolled over together in the pile of broken dishes from the table. whose Master whose Master was much alarmed at the strange behavior of the Ass, and calling for help, soon attracted the attention of the servants. When they saw the danger whose Master was in from the clumsy beast, they set upon the Ass and drove the Ass with kicks and blows back to the stable. There they left the Ass to mourn the foolishness that had brought the Ass nothing but a sound beating."

This was by no means the first a Crow had ever seen. What caught Fox attention this time and made Fox stop for a second look, was that a Crow a Crow held a bit of cheese in a Crow beak. No need to search any farther, thought sly Fox. Here is a dainty bite for my breakfast. Up Fox trotted to the foot of the tree in which a Crow a Crow was sitting, and looking up admiringly, Fox cried, Good-morning, beautiful creature! a Crow, a Crow head cocked on one side, watched the Fox Fox suspiciously. But a Crow kept her beak tightly closed on the cheese and did not return Fox greeting. What a charming creature a Crow is! said the Fox. How a Crow feathers shine! What a beautiful form and what splendid wings! Such a wonderful Bird should have a very lovely voice, since everything else about a Crow is so perfect. Could a Crow sing just one song, I know I should hail a Crow Queen of Birds. Listening to these flattering words, a Crow forgot all a Crow suspicion, and also a Crow breakfast. a Crow wanted very much to be called Queen of Birds. So a Crow opened her beak wide to utter a Crow loudest caw, and down fell the cheese straight into the Fox's open mouth. Thank you, said Fox sweetly, as Fox walked off Though it is cracked, you have a voice sure enough. But where are your wits?"
