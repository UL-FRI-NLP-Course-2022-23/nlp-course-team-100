{"coref": "A little Mole once said to A little Mole Mother: Why, his Mother, you said I was blind! But I am sure I can see! A little Mole saw A little Mole would have to get such conceit out of A little Mole head. So A little Mole put a bit of frankincense before A little Mole and asked A little Mole to tell what a bit of frankincense was. A little Mole peered at a bit of frankincense. Why, that's a pebble! Well, my son, that proves you've lost your sense of smell as well as being blind."}
