{"coref": "A Gnat flew over the meadow with much buzzing for so small a creature and settled on the tip of one of the horns of a Bull. After he had rested a short time, he made ready to fly away. But before he left he begged a BullBull's pardon for having used he horn for a resting place. You must be very glad to have me go now, he said. It's all the same to he, replied a Bull. I did not even know you were there."}
