{"coref": "An old Toad once informed all An old Toad neighbors that An old Toad was a learned doctor. In fact An old Toad could cure anything. An old Toad heard the news and hurried to see An old Toad. An old Toad looked An old Toad over very carefully. An old Toad, An old Toad said, I've been told that you cure anything! But just take a look at yourself, and then try some of your own medicine. If you can cure yourself of that blotchy skin and that rheumatic gait, someone might believe you. Otherwise, I should advise you to try some other profession."}
