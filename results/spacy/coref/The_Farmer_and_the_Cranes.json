{"coref": "Some Cranes saw a farmer plowing a large field. When the work of plowing was done, Some Cranes patiently watched a farmer plowing a large field sow the seed. It was Some Cranes feast, Some Cranes thought. So, as soon as the Farmer had finished planting and had gone home, down Some Cranes flew to a large field, and began to eat as fast as Some Cranes could. the Farmer, of course, knew the Cranes and Cranes ways. the Farmer had had experience with such birds before. the Farmer soon returned to a large field with a sling. But the Farmer did not bring any stones with the Farmer. the Farmer expected to scare Some Cranes just by swinging the sling in the air, and shouting loudly at Some Cranes. At first Some Cranes flew away in great terror. But Some Cranes soon began to see that none of Some Cranes ever got hurt. Some Cranes did not even hear the noise of stones whizzing through the air, and as for words, Some Cranes would kill nobody. At last Some Cranes paid no attention whatever to the Farmer. the Farmer saw that the Farmer would have to take other measures. the Farmer wanted to save at least some of the Farmer grain. So the Farmer loaded a sling with stones and killed several of Some Cranes. This had the effect the Farmer wanted, for from that day Some Cranes visited the Farmer field no more."}
