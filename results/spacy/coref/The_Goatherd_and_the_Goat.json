{"coref": "A Goat strayed away from the flock, tempted by a patch of clover. The Goatherd tried to call The Goatherd back, but in vain. The Goatherd would not obey The Goatherd. Then The Goatherd picked up a stone and threw a stone, breaking A Goat's horn. The Goatherd was frightened. Do not tell the master, The Goatherd begged A Goat. No, said A Goat, that the Goat's horn can speak for A Goat!"}
