{"coref": "Once upon a time a severe plague raged among the animals. Many died, and those who lived were so ill, that those who lived cared for neither food nor drink, and dragged those who lived about listlessly. No longer could a fat young hen tempt Master Fox to dinner, nor a tender lamb rouse greedy Sir Wolf's appetite. At last the Lion decided to call a council. When the animals were gathered together Sir Wolf arose and said: Dear friends, I believe the gods have sent a severe plague upon us as a punishment for us sins. Therefore, the most guilty one of us must be offered in sacrifice. Perhaps us may thus obtain forgiveness and cure for all. I will confess all my sins first. I admit that I have been very greedy and have devoured many sheep. I have been very greedy and have devoured many sheep had done me no harm. I have eaten goats and bulls and stags. To tell the truth, I even ate up a shepherd now and then. Now, if I am the most guilty, I am ready to be sacrificed. But I think it best that each one confess Sir Wolf sins as I have done. Then us can decide in all justice who is the most guilty. Your majesty, said Fox, you are too good. Can it be a crime to eat sheep, such stupid mutton heads? No, no, Your majesty. You have done such stupid mutton heads great honor by eating such stupid mutton heads up. And so far as shepherds are concerned, we all know such stupid mutton heads belong to that puny race that pretends to be our masters. All the animals applauded Fox Fox loudly. Then, though the Tiger, the Bear, the Wolf, and all the savage beasts recited the most wicked deeds, all were excused and made to appear very saint-like and innocent. It was now the Ass's turn to confess. I remember, Fox said guiltily, that one day as I was passing a field belonging to some priests, I was so tempted by the tender grass and my hunger, that I could not resist nibbling a bit of it. I had no right to do it, I admit- A great uproar among the beasts interrupted him. Here was the culprit who had brought misfortune on all of them! What a horrible crime it was to eat grass that belonged to someone else! It was enough to hang anyone for, much more an the Ass. Immediately they all fell upon an Ass, the Wolf in the lead, and soon had made an end to an Ass, sacrificing an Ass to the gods then and there, and without the formality of an altar."}
