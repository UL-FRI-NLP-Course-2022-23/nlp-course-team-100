{"coref": "The Owl always takes The Owl sleep during the day. Then after sundown, when the rosy light fades from the sky and the shadows rise slowly through the wood, out The Owl comes ruffling and blinking from the old hollow tree. Now The Owl weird hoo-hoo-hoo-oo-oo echoes through the wood, and The Owl begins The Owl hunt for the bugs and beetles, frogs and mice The Owl likes so well to eat. Now there was a certain old Owl who had become very cross and hard to please as The Owl grew older, especially if anything disturbed The Owl daily slumbers. One warm summer afternoon as The Owl dozed away in The Owl den in the old oak tree, a Grasshopper nearby began a joyous but very raspy song. Out popped the old Owl's head from the opening in the tree that served The Owl both for door and for window. Get away from here, sir, The Owl said to a Grasshopper. Have you no manners?, You should at least respect my age and leave me to sleep in quiet! But a Grasshopper a Grasshopper answered saucily that a Grasshopper had as much right to a Grasshopper place in the sun as the Owl had to Owl place in the old oak. Then a Grasshopper struck up a louder and still more rasping tune. the Owl knew quite well that the Owl would do no good to argue with a Grasshopper, nor with anybody else for that matter. Besides, Owl eyes were not sharp enough by day to permit Owl to punish a Grasshopper as the Owl deserved. So Owl laid aside all hard words and spoke very kindly to the Owl. Well sir, Owl said, if I must stay awake, I am going to settle right down to enjoy your singing. Now that I think of it, I have a wonderful wine here, sent me from Olympus, of which I am told Apollo drinks before Apollo sings to the high gods. Please come up and taste this delicious drink with sir. I know it will make you sing like Apollo. a Grasshopper a Grasshopper was taken in by the Owl's flattering words. Up a Grasshopper jumped to the Owl's den, but as soon as a Grasshopper was near enough so the Owl could see a Grasshopper clearly, Owl pounced upon a Grasshopper and ate a Grasshopper up."}
