{"coref": "Two Travellers, walking in the noonday sun, sought the shade of a widespreading tree to rest. As they lay looking up among the pleasant leaves, they saw that the Plane. How useless is the Plane!, said one of they. the Plane bears no fruit whatever, and only serves to litter the ground with leaves. Ungrateful creatures! said a voice from the Plane Tree. You lie here in my cooling shade, and yet you say I am useless! Thus ungratefully, O Jupiter, do men receive men blessings!"}
