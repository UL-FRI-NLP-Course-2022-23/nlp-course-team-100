{"coref": "A poor Fisherman, who lived on the fish he caught, had bad luck one day and caught nothing but a very small fry. The Fisherman was about to put it in The Fisherman basket when the little Fish said: Please spare me, The Fisherman! I am so small it is not worth while to carry me home. When I am bigger, I shall make you a much better meal. But The Fisherman quickly put the little Fish into his basket. How foolish I should be, The Fisherman said, to throw you back. However small you may be, you are better than nothing at all."}
