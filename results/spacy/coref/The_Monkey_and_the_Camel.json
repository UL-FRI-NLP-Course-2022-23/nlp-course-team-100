{"coref": "At a great celebration in honor of King Lion, the Monkey was asked to dance for the company. the Monkey dancing was very clever indeed, and the animals were all highly pleased with the Monkey grace and lightness. The praise that was showered on the Monkey made the Camel envious. the Monkey was very sure that the Monkey could dance quite as well as the Monkey, if not better, so the Monkey pushed the Monkey way into the crowd that was gathered around the Monkey, and rising on the Monkey hind legs, began to dance. But the big hulking Camel made the Monkey very ridiculous as the Monkey kicked out the Monkey knotty legs and twisted the Monkey long clumsy neck. Besides, the animals found it hard to keep the animals toes from under the Monkey heavy hoofs. At last, when one of the Monkey huge feet came within an inch of King Lion's nose, the animals were so disgusted that the animals set upon the Camel in a rage and drove the Monkey out into the desert. Shortly afterward, refreshments, consisting mostly of the Camel's hump and ribs, were served to the Camel."}
