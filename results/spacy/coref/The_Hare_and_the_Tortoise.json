{"coref": "A Hare was making fun of the Tortoise one day for being so slow. Do you ever get anywhere? A Hare asked with a mocking laugh. Yes, replied the Tortoise, and I get there sooner than you think. I'll run you a race and prove a race. A Hare Hare was much amused at the idea of running a race with the Tortoise, but for the fun of the thing A Hare agreed. So the Fox, who had consented to act as judge, marked the distance and started the runners off. A Hare Hare was soon far out of sight, and to make the Tortoise feel very deeply how ridiculous the Tortoise was for A Hare to try a race with A Hare, A Hare lay down beside the course to take a nap until the Tortoise should catch up. the Tortoise meanwhile kept going slowly but steadily, and, after a time, passed the place where A Hare was sleeping. But A Hare A Hare slept on very peacefully; and when at last A Hare did wake up, the Tortoise was near the goal. A Hare now ran A Hare swiftest, but A Hare could not overtake the Tortoise in time."}
