{"coref": "A store of honey had been found in a hollow tree, and the Wasps declared positively that The Bees. The Bees were just as sure that the treasure was The Bees. The argument grew very pointed, and The argument looked as if the affair could not be settled without a battle, when at last, with much good sense, The Bees agreed to let the Judge decide the matter. So The Bees brought the case before the Hornet, justice of the peace in that part of the woods. When the Judge called the case, witnesses declared that witnesses had seen certain winged creatures in the neighborhood of the hollow tree, who hummed loudly, and whose bodies were striped, yellow and black, like Bees. Counsel for the Wasps the Wasps immediately insisted that this description fitted his clients exactly. Such evidence did not help Judge Hornet to any decision, so Judge Hornet adjourned the Court for six weeks to give Judge Hornet time to think it over. When the case came up again, both sides had a large number of witnesses. An Ant was first to take the stand, and was about to be cross-examined, when a wise old Bee addressed the Court. Your honor, a wise old Bee said, the case has now been pending for six weeks. If the case is not decided soon, the honey will not be fit for anything. I move that the Bees and the Wasps be both instructed to build a honey comb. Then we shall soon see to whom the honey really belongs. the Wasps the Wasps protested loudly. Judge Hornet Judge Hornet quickly understood why the Wasps did so: the Wasps knew the Wasps could not build a honey comb and fill a honey comb with honey. It is clear, said the Judge, who made a honey comb and who could not have made it. the honey belongs to the Bees."}
