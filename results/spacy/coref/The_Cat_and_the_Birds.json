{"coref": "A Cat was growing very thin. As you have guessed, A Cat did not get enough to eat. One day A Cat heard that some Birds in the neighborhood were ailing and needed a doctor. So A Cat put on a pair of spectacles, and with a leather box in A Cat hand, knocked at the door of the Bird's home. some Birds in the neighborhood peeped out, and Dr. Cat, with much solicitude, asked how some Birds in the neighborhood were. A Cat would be very happy to give some Birds in the neighborhood some medicine. Tweet, tweet, laughed some Birds in the neighborhood. Very smart, aren't you? We are very well, thank you, and more so, if you only keep away from here."}
