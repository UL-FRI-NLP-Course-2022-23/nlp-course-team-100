{"coref": "Two Travelers were walking along the seashore, Far out Two Travelers saw something riding on the waves. Look, said one, a great ship rides in from distant lands, bearing rich treasures! The object Two Travelers saw came ever nearer the shore. No, said the other, that is not a treasure ship. That is some fisherman's skiff, with the day's catch of savoury fish. Still nearer came The object they saw. the waves washed The object they saw up on shore. The object they saw is a chest of gold lost from some wreck, they cried. Two Travelers rushed to the beach, but there Two Travelers found nothing but a water-soaked log."}
