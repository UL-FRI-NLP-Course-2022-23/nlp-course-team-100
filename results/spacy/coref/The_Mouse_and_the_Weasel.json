{"coref": "A little hungry Mouse found A little hungry Mouse way one day into a basket of corn. A little hungry Mouse had to squeeze A little hungry Mouse a good deal to get through the narrow opening between the strips of a basket of corn. But a basket of corn was tempting and A little hungry Mouse was determined to get in. When at last A little hungry Mouse had succeeded, A little hungry Mouse gorged A little hungry Mouse to bursting. Indeed A little hungry Mouse became about three times as big around the middle as A little hungry Mouse was when A little hungry Mouse went in. At last A little hungry Mouse felt satisfied and dragged A little hungry Mouse to the opening to get out again. But the best A little hungry Mouse could do was to get A little hungry Mouse head out. So there A little hungry Mouse sat groaning and moaning, both from the discomfort inside A little hungry Mouse and A little hungry Mouse anxiety to escape from a basket of corn. Just then a Weasel came by, A little hungry Mouse understood the situation quickly. My friend, A little hungry Mouse said, I know what you've been doing. You've been stuffing. That's what you get. You will have to stay there till you feel just like you did when you went in. Good night, and good enough for My friend. And that was all the sympathy A little hungry Mouse A little hungry Mouse got."}
