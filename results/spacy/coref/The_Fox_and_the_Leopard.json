{"coref": "A Fox and a Leopard, resting lazily after a generous dinner, amused A Fox and a Leopard by disputing about A Fox and a Leopard good looks. The Leopard was very proud of The Leopard glossy, spotted coat and made disdainful remarks about the Fox, whose appearance The Leopard declared was quite ordinary. Fox Fox prided Fox on Fox fine bushy tail with The Leopard tip of white, but Fox was wise enough to see that Fox could not rival the Leopard in looks. Still Fox kept up a flow of sarcastic talk, just to exercise Fox wits and to have the fun of disputing. The Leopard was about to lose Fox temper when Fox Fox got up, yawning lazily. You may have a very smart coat, Fox said, but you would be a great deal better off if you had a little more smartness inside your head and less on your ribs, the way I am. That's what I call real beauty."}
