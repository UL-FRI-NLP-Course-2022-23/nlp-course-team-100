{"coref": "A Raven, which you know is black as coal, was envious of the Swan, because her feathers were as white as the purest snow. The foolish bird got the idea that if The foolish bird lived like the Swan, swimming and diving all day long and eating the weeds and plants that grow in the water, The foolish bird would turn white like the Swan's. So The foolish bird left The foolish bird home in the woods and fields and flew down to live on the lakes and in the marshes. But though The foolish bird washed and washed all day long, almost drowning The foolish bird at it, The foolish bird remained as black as ever. And as the water weeds The foolish bird ate did not agree with The foolish bird, The foolish bird got thinner and thinner, and at last The foolish bird died."}
