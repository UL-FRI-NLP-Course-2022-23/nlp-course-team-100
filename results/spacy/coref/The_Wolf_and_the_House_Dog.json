{"coref": "There was once a Wolf who got very little to eat because the Dogs of the village were so wide awake and watchful. a Wolf who got very little to eat was really nothing but skin and bones, and it made a Wolf who got very little to eat very downhearted to think of it. One night a Wolf who got very little to eat Wolf happened to fall in with a fine fat House Dog who had wandered a little too far from home. a Wolf who got very little to eat Wolf would gladly have eaten a Wolf who got very little to eat then and there, but a fine fat House Dog who had wandered a little too far from home looked strong enough to leave a Wolf who got very little to eat marks should a Wolf who got very little to eat try his marks. So a Wolf who got very little to eat Wolf spoke very humbly to a fine fat House Dog who had wandered a little too far from home, complimenting a Wolf who got very little to eat on a Wolf who got very little to eat fine appearance. You can be as well-fed as I am if you want to, replied a fine fat House Dog who had wandered a little too far from homea fine fat House Dog who had wandered a little too far from home. Leave the woods; there you live miserably. Why, you have to fight hard for every bite you get. Follow my example and you will get along beautifully. What must I do? asked a Wolf who got very little to eat anything, answered a fine fat House Dog who had wandered a little too far from home. Chase people who carry canes, bark at beggars, and fawn on the people of House. In return you will get tidbits of every kind, chicken bones, choice bits of meat, sugar, cake, and much more beside, not to speak of kind words and caresses. a Wolf who got very little to eat a Wolf who got very little to eat had such a beautiful vision of a Wolf who got very little to eat coming happiness that a Wolf who got very little to eat almost wept. But just then a Wolf who got very little to eat noticed that the hair on a fine fat House Dog who had wandered a little too far from home's neck was worn and the skin was chafed. What is that on the Dog's neck? Nothing at all, replied a fine fat House Dog who had wandered a little too far from home. What! nothing! Oh, just a trifle!, But please tell me. Perhaps you see the mark of the collar to which my chain is fastened. What! A chain!,cried a Wolf who got very little to eat. Don't you go wherever you please? Not always! But what's the difference? replied a fine fat House Dog who had wandered a little too far from home. All the difference in the world!, I don't care a rap for your feasts and I wouldn't take all the tender young lambs in the world at that price. And away ran a Wolf who got very little to eat a Wolf who got very little to eat to the woods."}
