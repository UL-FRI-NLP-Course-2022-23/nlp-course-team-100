{"coref": "A hungry Wolf spied a Goat browsing at the top of a steep cliff where Wolf could not possibly get at A hungry Wolf. That is a very dangerous place for you, Wolf called out, pretending to be very anxious about the Goat's safety. What if you should fall! Please listen to Wolf and come down! Here you can get all you want of the finest, tenderest grass in the country. the Goat looked over the edge of the cliff. How very, very anxious you are about the Goat, the Goat said, and how generous you are with your grass! But I know you!, It's your own appetite you are thinking of, not the Goat!"}
