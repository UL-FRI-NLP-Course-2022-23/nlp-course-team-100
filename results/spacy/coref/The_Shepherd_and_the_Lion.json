{"coref": "A Shepherd, counting Shepherd Sheep one day, discovered that a number of A Shepherd, counting his Sheep one day were missing. Much irritated, Shepherd very loudly and boastfully declared that Shepherd would catch the thief and punish the thief as Shepherd deserved. Shepherd suspected a Wolf of the deed and so set out toward a rocky region among the hills, where there were caves infested by Wolves. But before starting out Shepherd made a vow to Jupiter that if Shepherd would help Shepherd find the thief Shepherd would offer a fat Calf as a sacrifice. Shepherd searched a long time without finding any Wolves, but just as Shepherd was passing near a large cave on the mountain side, a huge Lion stalked out, carrying a Sheep. In great terror Shepherd fell on a huge Lion knees. Alas, O Jupiter, man does not know what man asks! To find the thief I offered to sacrifice a fat Calf. Now I promise you a full-grown Bull, if you but make the thief I offered to sacrifice a fat Calf go away!"}
