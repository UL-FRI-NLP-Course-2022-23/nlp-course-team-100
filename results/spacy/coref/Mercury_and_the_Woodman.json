{"coref": "A poor Woodman was cutting down a tree near the edge of a deep pool in the forest. A poor Woodman was late in the day and A poor Woodman A poor Woodman was tired. A poor Woodman had been working since sunrise and A poor Woodman strokes were not so sure as they had been early that morning. Thus it happened that the axe slipped and flew out of A poor Woodman hands into the pool. A poor Woodman A poor Woodman was in despair. the axe was all A poor Woodman possessed with which to make a living, and A poor Woodman had not money enough to buy a new one. As A poor Woodman stood wringing A poor Woodman hands and weeping, the god Mercury suddenly appeared and asked what the trouble was. A poor Woodman A poor Woodman told what had happened, and straightway the kind Mercury dived into the pool. When A poor Woodman came up again A poor Woodman held a wonderful golden axe. Is this a wonderful golden axe? Mercury asked A poor Woodman. No, answered A poor Woodman, that is not a wonderful golden axe. Mercury laid a wonderful golden axe on the bank and sprang back into the pool. This time A poor Woodman brought up an axe of silver, but A poor Woodman A poor Woodman declared again that a wonderful golden axe was just an ordinary one with a wooden handle. Mercury dived down for the third time, and when A poor Woodman came up again A poor Woodman had a wonderful golden axe. A poor Woodman A poor Woodman was very glad that a wonderful golden axe had been found and could not thank the kind god enough. Mercury was greatly pleased with A poor Woodman's honesty. I admire your honesty, A poor Woodman said, and as a reward you may have all three axes, the gold and the silver as well as your own. A poor Woodman A poor Woodman returned to A poor Woodman home with A poor Woodman treasures, and soon the story of A poor Woodman good fortune was known to everybody in the village. Now there were several Woodmen in the village who believed that they could easily win the same good fortune. they hurried out into the woods, one here, one there, and hiding they axes in the bushes, pretended they had lost they. Then they wept and wailed and called on Mercury to help they. And indeed, Mercury did appear, first to this one, then to that. To each one each one showed an axe of gold, and each one eagerly claimed an axe of gold to be the one each one had lost. But Mercury did not give they an axe of gold. Oh no! Instead each one gave they each a hard whack over the head with the head and sent they home. And when they returned next day to look for they own axes, they were nowhere to be found."}
