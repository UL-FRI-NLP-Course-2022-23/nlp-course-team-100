{"coref": "A long time ago, the Lion, the Fox, the Jackal, and the Wolf agreed to go hunting together, sharing with each other whatever the Lion, the Fox, the Jackal, and the Wolf found. One day the Wolf the Wolf ran down a Stag and immediately called the Wolf comrades to divide the spoil. Without being asked, the Lion placed the Lion at the head of the feast to do the carving, and, with a great show of fairness, began to count the guests. One, the Lion said, counting on the Lion claws, that is the Lion the Lion. Two, that's the Wolf, three, is the Jackal, and the Fox makes four. the Fox then very carefully divided a Stag into four equal parts. I am King Lion, the Fox said, when the Fox had finished, so of course I get the first part. the first part falls to the Fox because I am the strongest; and this is mine because I am the bravest. the Fox now began to glare at the others very savagely. If any of you have any claim to the part that is left, the Fox growled, stretching the Fox meaningly, now is the time to speak up."}
