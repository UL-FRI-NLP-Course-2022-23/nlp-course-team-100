{"coref": "Once there were two Cocks living in the same farmyard who could not bear the sight of each other. At last one day they flew up to fight it out, beak and claw. they fought until one of they was beaten and crawled off to a corner to hide. The Cock that had won the battle flew to the top of the hen-house, and, proudly flapping The Cock that had won the battle wings, crowed with all The Cock that had won the battle might to tell the world about The Cock that had won the battle victory. But an Eagle, circling overhead, heard the boasting chanticleer and, swooping down, carried The Cock that had won the battle off to The Cock that had won the battle nest. The Cock that had won the battle rival saw the deed, and coming out of His rival corner, took His rival place as master of the farmyard."}
