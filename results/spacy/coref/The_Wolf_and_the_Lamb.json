{"coref": "A stray Lamb stood drinking early one morning on the bank of a woodland stream. That very same morning a hungry Wolf came by farther up a woodland stream, hunting for something to eat. Wolf soon got Wolf eyes on A stray Lamb. As a rule a hungry Wolf snapped up such delicious morsels without making any bones about it, but A stray Lamb A stray Lamb looked so very helpless and innocent that a hungry Wolf Wolf felt A stray Lamb ought to have some kind of an excuse for taking its life. How dare you paddle around in my stream and stir up all the mud!, A stray Lamb shouted fiercely. You deserve to be punished severely for your rashness!, But, your highness, replied A stray Lamb, do not be angry! I cannot possibly muddy the water you are drinking up there. Remember, you are upstream and I am downstream. You do muddy the water you are drinking up there! retorted a hungry Wolf Wolf savagely, And besides, I have heard that you told lies about A stray Lamb last year! How could I have done so?, pleaded A stray Lamb I wasn't born until last year. If it wasn't you, it was your brother! I have no brothers. Well, then, snarled a hungry WolfWolf, It was someone in your family anyway. But no matter who it was, I do not intend to be talked out of my breakfast. And without more words a hungry Wolf Wolf seized A stray Lamb A stray Lamb and carried her off to the forest."}
