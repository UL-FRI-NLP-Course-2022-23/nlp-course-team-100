{"coref": "There was once an Ass whose Master also owned a Lap Dog. an Ass whose Master also owned a Lap Dog was a favorite and received many a pat and kind word from whose Master, as well as choice bits from an Ass whose Master also owned a Lap Dog plate. Every day an Ass whose Master also owned a Lap Dog an Ass whose Master also owned a Lap Dog would run to meet whose Master, frisking playfully about and leaping up to lick an Ass whose Master also owned a Lap Dog hands and face. All this an Ass whose Master also owned a Lap Dog an Ass whose Master also owned a Lap Dog saw with much discontent. Though an Ass whose Master also owned a Lap Dog was well fed, an Ass whose Master also owned a Lap Dog had much work to do; besides, whose Master hardly ever took any notice of an Ass whose Master also owned a Lap Dog. Now an Ass whose Master also owned a Lap Dog an Ass whose Master also owned a Lap Dog got it into an Ass whose Master also owned a Lap Dog silly head that all an Ass whose Master also owned a Lap Dog had to do to win whose Masterwhose Master's favor was to act like an Ass whose Master also owned a Lap Dog. So one day an Ass whose Master also owned a Lap Dog left an Ass whose Master also owned a Lap Dog stable and clattered eagerly into the house. Finding whose Master seated at the dinner table, an Ass whose Master also owned a Lap Dog kicked up an Ass whose Master also owned a Lap Dog heels and, with a loud bray, pranced giddily around the dinner table, upsetting his heels as an Ass whose Master also owned a Lap Dog did so. Then an Ass whose Master also owned a Lap Dog planted an Ass whose Master also owned a Lap Dog forefeet on whose Master's knees and rolled out an Ass whose Master also owned a Lap Dog tongue to lick whose Master's face, as an Ass whose Master also owned a Lap Dog had seen an Ass whose Master also owned a Lap Dog do. But an Ass whose Master also owned a Lap Dog weight upset the chair, and Ass and man rolled over together in the pile of broken dishes from the table. whose Master whose Master was much alarmed at the strange behavior of the Ass, and calling for help, soon attracted the attention of the servants. When they saw the danger whose Master was in from the clumsy beast, they set upon the Ass and drove the Ass with kicks and blows back to the stable. There they left the Ass to mourn the foolishness that had brought the Ass nothing but a sound beating."}
