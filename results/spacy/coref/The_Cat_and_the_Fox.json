{"coref": "Once a Cat and a Fox were traveling together. As a Cat and a Fox went along, picking up provisions on the way - a stray mouse here, a fat chicken there - a Cat and a Fox began an argument to while away the time between bites. And, as usually happens when comrades argue, the talk began to get personal. You think you are extremely clever, don't you? said Fox. Do you pretend to know more than Fox? Why, I know a whole sackful of tricks! Well, retorted the Cat, I admit I know one trick only, but that one, let me tell you, is worth a thousand of Fox! Just then, close by, they heard a hunter's horn and the yelping of a pack of hounds. In an instant the Cat was up a tree, hiding among the leaves. This is my trick, Fox called to Fox. Now let me see what Fox are worth. But Fox Fox had so many plans for escape Fox could not decide which one to try first. Fox dodged here and there with the hounds at Fox heels. Fox doubled on Fox tracks, Fox ran at top speed, Fox entered a dozen burrows, but all in vain. the hounds at his heels caught Fox, and soon put an end to the boaster and all Fox tricks."}
