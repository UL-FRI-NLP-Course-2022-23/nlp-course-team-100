{"coref": "One bright day in late autumn a family of Ants were bustling about in the warm sunshine, drying out the grain a family of Ants had stored up during the summer when a starving Grasshopper, his fiddle under his arm, came up and humbly begged for a bite to eat. What!, cried Ants in surprise, haven't you stored anything away for the winter? What in the world were you doing all last summer? I didn't have time to store up any food, whined Grasshopper; I was so busy making music that before I knew Grasshopper the summer was gone. Ants shrugged Ants shoulders in disgust. Making music, were you? Ants cried. Very well; now dance! And Ants turned Ants backs on Grasshopper and went on with Ants work."}
