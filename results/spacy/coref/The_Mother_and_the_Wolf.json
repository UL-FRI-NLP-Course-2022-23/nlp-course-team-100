Then Wolf heard the Mother's voice say: Hush, a child, hush! Stop your crying, or I will give you to a hungry WolfWolf! Surprised but delighted at the prospect of so delicious a meal, a hungry Wolf a hungry Wolf settled down under an open window, expecting every moment to have a child handed out to a hungry Wolf. But though the little one continued to fret, a hungry Wolf Wolf waited all day in vain. Then, toward nightfall, a hungry Wolf heard the Mother's voice again as the Mother sat down near an open window to sing and rock the Mother baby to sleep. There, child, there! a hungry Wolf a hungry Wolf shall not get you. No, no! Daddy is watching and Daddy will kill Daddy if Daddy should come near! Just then the Father came within sight of the home, and a hungry Wolf Wolf was barely able to save a hungry Wolf from the Dogs by a clever bit of running."}
