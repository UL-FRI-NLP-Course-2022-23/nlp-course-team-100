{"coref": "A Stag, drinking from a crystal spring, saw Stag mirrored in the clear water. Stag greatly admired the graceful arch of Stag antlers, but Stag was very much ashamed of Stag spindling legs. How can it be, Stag sighed, that I should be cursed with such legs when I have so magnificent a crown. At that moment Stag scented the Panther and in an instant was bounding away through the forest. But as Stag ran Stag wide-spreading antlers caught in the branches of the trees, and soon the Panther overtook Stag. Then the Stag perceived that the legs of which Stag was so ashamed would have saved Stag had it not been for the useless ornaments on Stag head."}
