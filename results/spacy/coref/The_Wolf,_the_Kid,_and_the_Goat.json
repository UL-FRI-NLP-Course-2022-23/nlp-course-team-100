{"coref": "Mother Goat was going to market one morning to get provisions for Mother Goat household, which consisted of but one little Kid and Mother Goat. Take good care of the house, my son, Mother Goat said to the Kid, as Mother Goat carefully latched the door. Do not let anyone in, unless he gives you this password: 'Down with the Wolf and all he race!' Strangely enough, a Wolf was lurking near and heard what Mother Goat had said. So, as soon as Mother Goat was out of sight, up a Wolf trotted to the door and knocked. Down with the Wolf and all his raceWolf a Wolf , said a Wolf a Wolf softly. It was the right password, but when the Kid the Kid peeped through a crack in the door and saw the shadowy figure outside, the shadowy figure did not feel at all easy. Show me a white paw, the shadowy figure said, or I won't let you in. A white paw, of course, is a feature few Wolves can show, and so a Wolf had to go away as hungry as a Wolf had come. You can never be too sure, said the Kid, when a Wolf saw a Wolf a Wolf making off to the woods."}
