{"coref": "The Lion had been badly hurt by the horns of a Goat, which The Lion was eating. The Lion was very angry to think that any animal that The Lion chose for a meal, should be so brazen as to wear such dangerous things as horns to scratch The Lion while The Lion ate. So The Lion commanded that all animals with horns should leave The Lion domains within twenty-four hours. The command struck terror among the beasts. All those who were so unfortunate as to have horns, began to pack up and move out. Even the Hare, who, as you know, has no horns and so had nothing to fear, passed a very restless night, dreaming awful dreams about The LionThe Lion. And when The Lion came out of the warren in the early morning sunshine, and there saw the shadow cast by The Lion long and pointed ears, a terrible fright seized The Lion. Goodby, neighbor Cricket, The Lion called. I'm off. The Lion will certainly make out that my ears are horns, no matter what I say."}
