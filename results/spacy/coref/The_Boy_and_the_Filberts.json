{"coref": "A Boy was given permission to put A Boy hand into a pitcher to get some filberts. But A Boy took such a great fistful that A Boy could not draw his hand out again. There A Boy stood, unwilling to give up a single filbert and yet unable to get them all out at once. Vexed and disappointed A Boy began to cry. A Boy, said A Boy mother, be satisfied with half the nuts you have taken and you will easily get your hand out. Then perhaps you may have some more filberts some other time."}
