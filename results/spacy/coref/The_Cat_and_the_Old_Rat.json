{"coref": "There was once a Cat who was so watchful, that a Mouse hardly dared show the tip of a Mouse whiskers for fear of being eaten alive. That Cat seemed to be everywhere at once with Cat claws all ready for a pounce. At last the Mice kept so closely to the Mice dens, that Cat Cat saw Cat would have to use Cat wits well to catch one. So one day Cat climbed up on a shelf and hung from a shelf, head downward, as if Cat were dead, holding Cat up by clinging to some ropes with one paw. When the Mice peeped out and saw Cat in that position, the Mice thought Cat had been hung up there in punishment for some misdeed. Very timidly at first the Mice stuck out the Mice heads and sniffed about carefully. But as nothing stirred, all trooped joyfully out to celebrate the death of Cat. Just then Cat let go Cat hold, and before the Mice recovered from the Mice surprise, Cat had made an end of three or four. Now the Mice kept more strictly at home than ever. But the Cat, who was still hungry for Mice, knew more tricks than one. Rolling Cat in flour until Cat was covered completely, Cat lay down in the flour bin, with one eye open for the Mice. Sure enough, the Mice soon began to come out. To Cat it was almost as if Cat already had a plump young Mouse under Cat claws, when an old Rat, who had had much experience with Cats and traps, and had even lost a part of Cat tail to pay for it, sat up at a safe distance from a hole in the wall where Cat lived. Take care! Cat cried. That may be a heap of meal, but it looks to Cat very much like Cat. Whatever it is, it is wisest to keep at a safe distance."}
