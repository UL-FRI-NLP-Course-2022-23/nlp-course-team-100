{"coref": "A Dove saw an Ant fall into a brook. Ant Ant struggled in vain to reach the bank, and in pity, A Dove dropped a blade of straw close beside A Dove. Clinging to the straw like a shipwrecked sailor to a broken spar, Ant floated safely to shore. Soon after, Ant saw a man getting ready to kill A Dove with a stone. But just as a man cast a stone, Ant stung a man in the heel, so that the pain made a man miss a man aim, and A Dove flew to safety in a distant wood."}
