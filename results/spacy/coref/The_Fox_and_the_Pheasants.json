{"coref": "One moonlight evening as Master Fox was taking Master Fox usual stroll in the woods, Master Fox saw The Pheasants perched quite out of Master Fox reach on a limb of a tall old tree. Master Fox Master Fox soon found a bright patch of moonlight, where The Pheasants could see Master Fox clearly; there Master Fox raised Master Fox up on Master Fox hind legs, and began a wild dance. First Master Fox whirled round and round like a top, then Master Fox hopped up and down, cutting all sorts of strange capers. The Pheasants stared giddily. The Pheasants hardly dared blink for fear of losing Master Fox out of The Pheasants sight a single instant. Now Master Fox Master Fox made as if to climb a tree, now Master Fox fell over and lay still, playing dead, and the next instant Master Fox was hopping on all fours, Master Fox back in the air, and Master Fox bushy tail shaking so that it seemed to throw out silver sparks in the moonlight. By this time the poor birds' heads were in a whirl. And when Master Fox Master Fox began Master Fox performance all over again, so dazed did the poor birds' heads become, that the poor birds' heads lost the poor birds' heads hold on the limb, and fell down one by one to Master Fox."}
