{"coref": "Once upon a time a Cat and a Monkey lived as pets in the same house. pets were great friends and were constantly in all sorts of mischief together. What pets seemed to think of more than anything else was to get something to eat, and it did not matter much to pets how pets got it. One day pets were sitting by the fire, watching some chestnuts roasting on the hearth. How to get pets was the question. I would gladly get pets, said a Monkey, but you are much more skillful at such things than I am. Pull pets out and I'll divide pets between us. Pussy stretched out Pussy paw very carefully, pushed aside some of the cinders, and drew back Pussy paw very quickly. Then Pussy tried paw again, this time pulling a chestnut half out of the fire. A third time and Pussy drew out a chestnut. This performance Pussy went through several times, each time singeing her paw severely. As fast as Pussy pulled the chestnuts out of the fire, a Monkey ate the chestnuts up. Now the master came in, and away scampered the rascals, Mistress Cat with a burnt paw and no chestnuts. From that time on, they say, Pussy contented Pussy with mice and rats and had little to do with a Monkey."}
