{"coref": "A Wolf prowling near a village one evening met a Dog. It happened to be a very lean and bony Dog, and Wolf would have turned up Wolf nose at such meager fare had Wolf not been more hungry than usual. So Wolf began to edge toward a Dog, while a Dog a Dog backed away. Let me remind your lordship, said the Dog, Wolf words interrupted now and then as Wolf dodged a snap of WolfWolf's teeth, how unpleasant it would be to eat me now. Look at my ribs. I am nothing but skin and bone. But let me tell you something in private. In a few days Wolf will give a wedding feast for Wolf only daughter. You can guess how fine and fat I will grow on the scraps from the table. Then is the time to eat me. Wolf Wolf could not help thinking how nice it would be to have a fine fat Dog to eat instead of the scrawny object before Wolf. So Wolf went away pulling in Wolf belt and promising to return. Some days later Wolf Wolf came back for a wedding feast. Wolf found a Dog in Wolf's yard, and asked Wolf to come out and be eaten. Wolf, said a Dog, with a grin, I shall be delighted to have you eat me. I'll be out as soon as the porter opens the door. But the porter was a huge a Dog whom Wolf Wolf knew by painful experience to be very unkind toward wolves. So the porter decided not to wait and made off as fast as the porter legs could carry the porter."}
