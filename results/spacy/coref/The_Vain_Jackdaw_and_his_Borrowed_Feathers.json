Now A Jackdaw Jackdaw was not a very handsome bird, nor very refined in manner. Yet A Jackdaw imagined that all A Jackdaw needed to make A Jackdaw fit for the society of the Peacocks was a dress like theirs. So A Jackdaw picked up some castoff feathers of the Peacocks and stuck some castoff feathers of the Peacocks among A Jackdaw own black plumes. Dressed in A Jackdaw borrowed finery A Jackdaw strutted loftily among the birds of A Jackdaw own kind. Then A Jackdaw flew down into the garden of the King's palacethe Peacocks. But some castoff feathers of the Peacocks soon saw who A Jackdaw was. Angry at the cheat, some castoff feathers of the Peacocks flew at A Jackdaw, plucking away the borrowed feathers and also some of A Jackdaw own. A Jackdaw returned sadly to A Jackdaw former companions. There another unpleasant surprise awaited A Jackdaw. some castoff feathers of the Peacocks had not forgotten A Jackdaw superior airs toward some castoff feathers of the Peacocks, and, to punish A Jackdaw, some castoff feathers of the Peacocks drove A Jackdaw away with a rain of pecks and jeers."}
