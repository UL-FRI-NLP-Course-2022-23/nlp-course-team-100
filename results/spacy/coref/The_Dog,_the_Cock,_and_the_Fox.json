{"coref": "A Dog and a Cock, who were the best of friends, wished very much to see something of the world. So A Dog and a Cock, who were the best of friends decided to leave the farmyard and to set out into the world along the road that led to the woods. The two comrades traveled along in the very best of spirits and without meeting any adventure to speak of. At nightfall the Cock, looking for a place to roost, as was his custom, spied nearby a hollow tree that his thought would do very nicely for a night's lodging. The Dog could creep inside and the Cock would fly up on one of the branches. So said, so done, and both slept very comfortably. With the first glimmer of dawn the Cock awoke. For the moment his forgot just where his was. his thought his was still in the farmyard where it had been his duty to arouse the household at daybreak. So standing on tip-toes his flapped his wings and crowed lustily. But instead of awakening the farmer, his awakened a Fox not far off in the wood. a Fox a Fox immediately had rosy visions of a very delicious breakfast. Hurrying to the tree where the Cock was roosting, his said very politely: A hearty welcome to our woods, honored sir. I cannot tell you how glad I am to see you here. I am quite sure our shall become the closest of friends. I feel highly flattered, sir, replied the Cock slyly. If you will please go around to the door of my house at the foot of the tree, my porter will let you in. The hungry but unsuspecting a Fox, went around the tree as a Fox was told, and in a twinkling the Dog had seized a Fox."}
