{"coref": "There was once a little Kid whose growing horns made Kid think Kid was a grown-up Billy Goat and able to take care of Kid. So one evening when the flock started home from the pasture and Kid mother called, Kid paid no heed and kept right on nibbling the tender grass. A little later when Kid lifted Kid head, the flock was gone. Kid was all alone. The sun was sinking. Long shadows came creeping over the ground. A chilly little wind came creeping with the flock making scary noises in the grass. Kid shivered as Kid thought of the terrible Wolf. Then Kid started wildly over the field, bleating for his mother. But not half-way, near a clump of trees, there was WolfWolf! Kid Kid knew there was little hope for Kid. Please, Wolf, Wolf said trembling, I know you are going to eat me. But first please pipe me a tune, for I want to dance and be merry as long as I can. Wolf Wolf liked the idea of a little music before eating, so Wolf struck up a merry tune and Kid leaped and frisked gaily. Meanwhile, the flock was moving slowly homeward. In the still evening air WolfWolf's piping carried far. The Shepherd Dogs pricked up The Shepherd Dogs ears. The Shepherd Dogs recognized the song Wolf Wolf sings before a feast, and in a moment The Shepherd Dogs were racing back to the pasture. the song the Wolf sings ended suddenly, and as he ran, with the Dogs at he heels, he called he a fool for turning piper to please a Kid, when he should have stuck to he butcher's trade."}
