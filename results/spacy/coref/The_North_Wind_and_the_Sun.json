{"coref": "The North Wind and the Sun had a quarrel about which of The North Wind and the Sun was the stronger. While The North Wind and the Sun were disputing with much heat and bluster, a Traveler passed along the road wrapped in a cloak. Let us agree, said the Sun, that he is the stronger who can strip that Traveler of he cloak. Very well, growled the North Wind, and at once sent a cold, howling blast against Traveler of his cloak. With the first gust of wind the ends of his cloak whipped about Traveler of his cloak's body. But he immediately wrapped the Traveler's body closely around he, and the harder the North Wind blew, the tighter he held the Traveler's body to he. the North Wind tore angrily at his cloak, but all he efforts were in vain. Then the Sun the Sun began to shine. At first he beams were gentle, and in the pleasant warmth after the bitter cold of the North Wind, Traveler of his cloak unfastened his cloak and let his cloak hang loosely from he shoulders. the Sunthe Sun's rays grew warmer and warmer. he took off he cap and mopped he brow. At last he became so heated that he pulled off his cloak, and, to escape the blazing sunshine, threw he down in the welcome shade of a tree by the roadside."}
