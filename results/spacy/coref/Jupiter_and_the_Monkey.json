{"coref": "There was once a baby show among the Animals in the forest. Jupiter provided the prize. Of course all the proud mammas from far and near brought Jupiter babies. But none got there earlier than Mother Monkey. Proudly Mother Monkey presented Mother Monkey baby among the other contestants. As you can imagine, there was quite a laugh when the Animals saw the ugly flat-nosed, hairless, pop-eyed little creature. Laugh if you will, said Mother Monkey. Though Jupiter may not give Mother Monkey the prize, I know that Mother Monkey is the prettiest, the sweetest, the dearest darling in the world."}
