{"coref": "A Mule had had a long rest and much good feeding. A Mule was feeling very vigorous indeed, and pranced around loftily, holding A Mule head high. My father certainly was a full-blooded racer, My father said. I can feel that distinctly. Next day My father was put into harness again and that evening My father was very downhearted indeed. I was mistaken, My father said. My father was an Ass after all."}
