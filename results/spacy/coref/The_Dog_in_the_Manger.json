{"coref": "A Dog asleep in a manger filled with hay, was awakened by the Cattle, which came in tired and hungry from working in the field. But A Dog would not let the Cattle, which came in tired and hungry from working in the field get near the manger, and snarled and snapped as if A Dog were filled with the best of meat and bones, all for A Dog. The Cattle looked at A Dog in disgust. How selfish A Dog is! said one. A Dog cannot eat the hay and yet A Dog will not let us eat the hay who are so hungry for the hay! Now the farmer came in. When the farmer saw how A Dog A Dog was acting, the farmer seized a stick and drove the farmer out of the stable with many a blow for the farmer selfish behavior."}
