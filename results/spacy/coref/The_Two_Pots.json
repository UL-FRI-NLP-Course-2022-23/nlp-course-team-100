{"coref": "Two Pots, one of brass and the other of clay, stood together on the hearthstone. One day the Brass Pot proposed to the Brass Pot that the Brass Pot go out into the world together. But the Brass Pot the Brass Pot excused the Brass Pot, saying that it would be wiser for the Brass Pot to stay in the corner by the fire. It would take so little to break me, the Brass Pot said, You know how fragile I am. The least shock is sure to shatter me! Don't let that keep you at home, urged the Brass Pot. I shall take very good care of you. If we should happen to meet anything hard I will step between and save you. So the Brass Pot at last consented, and the two set out side by side, jolting along on three stubby legs first to side, then to that, and bumping into each other at every step. the Brass Pot could not survive that sort of companionship very long. the Brass Pot had not gone ten paces before the Brass Pot cracked, and at the next jolt the Brass Pot flew into a thousand pieces."}
