{"coref": "One cold stormy day a Goatherd drove a Goatherd Goats for shelter into a cave, where a number of Wild Goats had also found their way. The Shepherd wanted to make the Wild Goats part of Shepherd flock; so Shepherd fed their well. But to his flock, Shepherd gave only just enough food to keep their alive. When the weather cleared, and The Shepherd led the Wild Goats out to feed, the Wild Goats scampered off to the hills. Is that the thanks I get for feeding you and treating you so well? complained The Shepherd. Do not expect us to join his flock, replied one of the Wild Goats. us know how you would treat us later on, if some strangers should come as us did."}
