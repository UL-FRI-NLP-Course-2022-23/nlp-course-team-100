{"coref": "A Farmer was driving A Farmer wagon along a miry country road after a heavy rain. The horses could hardly drag the load through the deep mud, and at last came to a standstill when one of the wheels sank to the hub in a rut. A Farmer climbed down from A Farmer seat and stood beside his wagon looking at his wagon but without making the least effort to get his wagon out of the rut. All A Farmer did was to curse A Farmer bad luck and call loudly on Hercules to come to A Farmer aid. Then, it is said, Hercules really did appear, saying: Put your shoulder to the wheel, man, and urge on your horses. Do you think you can move his wagon by simply looking at his wagon and whining about his wagon? Hercules will not help unless you make some effort to help yourself. And when A Farmer put A Farmer shoulder to the wheel and urged on The horses, his wagon moved very readily, and soon A Farmer was riding along in great content and with a good lesson learned."}
