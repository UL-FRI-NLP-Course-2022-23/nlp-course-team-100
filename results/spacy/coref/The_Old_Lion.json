{"coref": "A Lion had grown very old. A Lion teeth were worn away. A Lion limbs could no longer bear A Lion, and the King of Beasts was very pitiful indeed as A Lion lay gasping on the ground, about to die. Where now A Lion strength and A Lion former graceful beauty? Now a Boar spied A Lion, and rushing at A Lion, gored A Lion with A Lion yellow tusk. A Bull trampled A Lion with A Bull heavy hoofs. Even a contemptible Ass let fly A Lion heels and brayed A Lion insults in the face of A Lion."}
