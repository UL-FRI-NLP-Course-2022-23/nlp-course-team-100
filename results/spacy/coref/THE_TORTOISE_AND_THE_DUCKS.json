{"coref": "The Tortoise, you know, carries The Tortoise house on The Tortoise back. No matter how hard The Tortoise tries, The Tortoise cannot leave home. They say that Jupiter punished The Tortoise so, because The Tortoise was such a lazy stay-at-home that The Tortoise would not go to Jupiters wedding, even when especially invited. After many years, The Tortoise began to wish The Tortoise had gone to Jupiters wedding. When The Tortoise saw how gaily the birds flew about and how the Hare and the Chipmunk and all the other animals ran nimbly by, always eager to see everything there was to be seen, The Tortoise felt very sad and discontented. The Tortoise wanted to see the world too, and there The Tortoise was with a house on The Tortoise back and little short legs that could hardly drag The Tortoise along. One day The Tortoise met the Ducks and told the Ducks all The Tortoise trouble. We can help you to see the world, said the Ducks. Take hold of this stick with your teeth and We will carry you far up in the air where you can see the whole countryside. But keep quiet or you will be sorry. The Tortoise was very glad indeed. The Tortoise seized this stick firmly with The Tortoise teeth, the Ducks Ducks took hold of this stick one at each end, and away the Ducks sailed up toward the clouds. Just then a Crow flew by. The Tortoise was very much astonished at the strange sight and cried: This must surely be the King of Tortoises! Why certainly began The Tortoise. But as The Tortoise opened The Tortoise mouth to say these foolish words The Tortoise lost The Tortoise hold on this stick, and down The Tortoise fell to the ground, where The Tortoise was dashed to pieces on a rock."}
