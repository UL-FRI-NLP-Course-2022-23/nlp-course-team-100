{"coref": "A Bat blundered into the nest of a Weasel, who ran up to catch and eat Bat. Bat Bat begged for Bat life, but the Weasel would not listen. You are a Mouse, Bat said, and I am a sworn enemy of Mice. Every Mouse I catch, I am going to eat! But I am not a Mouse! cried Bat. Look at my wings. Can Mice fly? Why, I am only a Bird! Please let me go! the Weasel had to admit that Bat was not a Mouse, so the Weasel let the Weasel go. But a few days later, Bat Bat went blindly into the nest of another Weasel. another Weasel happened to be a bitter enemy of Birds, and another Weasel soon had Bat under another Weasel claws, ready to eat another Weasel. You are a Bird, another Weasel said, and I am going to eat you! What, cried the Bat, I, a Bird! Why, all Birds have feathers! I am nothing but a Mouse. 'Down with all Cats,' is my motto! And so Bat escaped with Bat life a second time."}
