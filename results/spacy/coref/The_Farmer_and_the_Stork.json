{"coref": "The Stork had been asked by the Cranes to visit a field that had been newly planted. But the Cranes ended dismally with all the birds entangled in the meshes of the Farmer's net. The Stork begged the Farmer to spare the Farmer. Please let me go, the Farmer pleaded. I belong to the Stork family who you know are honest and birds of good character. Besides, I did not know the Cranes were going to steal. You may be a very good bird, answered the Farmer, but I caught you with the Cranes and you will have to share the same punishment with the Cranes."}
