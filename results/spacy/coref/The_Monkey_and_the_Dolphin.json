Had it not been for the Dolphins, all would have perished. But the Dolphins took the shipwrecked people on the shipwrecked people backs and swam with the shipwrecked people to shore. Now it was the custom among the Greeks to take the Greeks pet monkeys and dogs with the Greeks whenever the Greeks went on a voyage. So when one of the Dolphins saw a Monkey struggling in the water, a Monkey thought a Monkey was a man, and made a Monkey climb up on a man back. Then off a man swam with a man toward shore. a Monkey a Monkey sat up, grave and dignified, on his back. You are a citizen of illustrious Athens, are you not?, asked the Dolphin the Dolphin politely. Yes, answered a Monkey, proudly. My family is one of the noblest in the city. Indeed, said the Dolphin. Then of course you often visit Piraeus. Yes, yes, replied a Monkey.Indeed, I do. I am with a man constantly. Piraeus is my very best friend. This answer took the Dolphin the Dolphin by surprise, and, turning a man head, a man now saw what it was a man was carrying. Without more ado, a man dived and left a Monkey to take care of a man, while a man swam off in search of some human being to save."}
