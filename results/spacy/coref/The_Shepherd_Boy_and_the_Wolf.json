{"coref": "A Shepherd Boy tended His Master's Sheep near a dark forest not far from the village. Soon A Shepherd Boy found life in the pasture very dull. All A Shepherd Boy could do to amuse A Shepherd Boy was to talk to A Shepherd Boy dog or play on A Shepherd Boy shepherd's pipe. One day as A Shepherd Boy sat watching the Sheep and the quiet forest, and thinking what A Shepherd Boy would do should A Shepherd Boy see a Wolf, A Shepherd Boy thought of a plan to amuse A Shepherd Boy. A Shepherd Boy Master had told A Shepherd Boy to call for help should a Wolf a Wolf attack the flock, and the Villagers would drive should a Wolf attack the flock away. So now, though A Shepherd Boy had not seen anything that even looked like a Wolfa Wolf, A Shepherd Boy ran toward the village shouting at the top of A Shepherd Boy voice, a Wolf! a Wolf!, As A Shepherd Boy expected, the Villagers who heard the cry dropped the Villagers who heard the cry work and ran in great excitement to the pasture. But when the Villagers who heard the cry got there the Villagers who heard the cry found A Shepherd Boy doubled up with laughter at the trick A Shepherd Boy had played on the Villagers who heard the cry. A few days later A Shepherd Boy again shouted, a Wolf!, a Wolf! Again the Villagers ran to help A Shepherd Boy, only to be laughed at again. Then one evening as the sun was setting behind the forest and the shadows were creeping out over the pasture, a Wolf a Wolf really did spring from the underbrush and fall upon the Sheep. In terror A Shepherd Boy ran toward the village shouting a Wolf! a Wolf!, But though the Villagers heard the cry, the Villagers did not run to help A Shepherd Boy as the Villagers had before. A Shepherd Boy cannot fool us again, the Villagers said. a Wolf a Wolf killed a great many of the Sheep and then slipped away into the forest."}
