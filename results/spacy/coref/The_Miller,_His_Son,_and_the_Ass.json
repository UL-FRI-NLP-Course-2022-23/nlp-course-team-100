{"coref": "One day, a long time ago, The Miller Miller were on The Miller way to market with an Ass which The Miller hoped to sell. The Miller drove The Miller very slowly, for The Miller thought The Miller would have a better chance to sell The Miller if The Miller kept The Miller in good condition. As The Miller walked along the highway some travelers laughed loudly at The Miller. What foolishness, cried one, to walk when The Miller might as well ride. The most stupid of the three is not the one you would expect it to be. The Miller did not like to be laughed at, so The Miller told his Son to climb up and ride. The Miller had gone a little farther along the road, when the Merchants passed by. Oho, what have we here? The Miller cried. Respect old age, young man! Get down, and let his Son ride. Though The Miller The Miller was not tired, The Miller made his Son get down and climbed up The Miller to ride, just to please the Merchants. At the next turnstile the Merchants overtook some women carrying market baskets loaded with vegetables and other things to sell. Look at the old fool, exclaimed one of the Merchants. Perched on the Ass, while his Son has to walk. The Miller The Miller felt a bit vexed, but to be agreeable The Miller told his Son to climb up behind The Miller. the Merchants had no sooner started out again than a loud shout went up from another company of people on the road. What a crime, cried one, to load up a poor dumb beast like that! the Merchants look more able to carry the poor creature, than his Son to carry the Merchants. the Merchants must be on the Merchants way to sell the poor thing's hide, said another. The The Miller and The Miller Son quickly scrambled down, and a short time later, the market place was thrown into an uproar as the two came along carrying the Donkey slung from a pole. A great crowd of people ran out to get a closer look at the strange sight. the Ass did not dislike being carried, but so many people came up to point at the Ass and laugh and shout, that the Ass began to kick and bray, and then, just as so many people were crossing a bridge, the ropes that held the Ass gave way, and down the Ass tumbled into the river. The poor The Miller now set out sadly for home. By trying to please everybody, The poor Miller had pleased nobody, and lost The poor Miller the Ass besides."}
