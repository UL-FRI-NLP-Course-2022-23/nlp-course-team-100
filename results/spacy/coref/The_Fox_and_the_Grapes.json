{"coref": "A Fox one day spied a beautiful bunch of ripe grapes hanging from a vine trained along the branches of a tree. ripe grapes hanging from a vine trained along the branches of a tree seemed ready to burst with juice, and Fox's mouth watered as Fox gazed longingly at them. a beautiful bunch of ripe grapes hanging from a vine trained along the branches of a tree hung from a high branch, and Fox Fox had to jump for it. The first time Fox jumped Fox missed it by a long way. So Fox walked off a short distance and took a running leap at it, only to fall short once more. Again and again Fox tried, but in vain. Now Fox sat down and looked at ripe grapes hanging from a vine trained along the branches of a tree in disgust. What a fool I am, Fox said, Here I am wearing Fox out to get a bunch of sour grapes that are not worth gaping for. And off Fox walked very, very scornfully."}
