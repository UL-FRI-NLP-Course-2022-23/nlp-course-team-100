{"coref": "A Lion and a Man chanced to travel in company through the forest. A Lion and a Man soon began to quarrel, for each of A Lion and a Man boasted that A Lion and a Man and A Lion and a Man kind were far superior to the other both in strength and mind. Now A Lion and a Man reached a clearing in the forest and there stood a statue. It was a representation of Heracles in the act of tearing the jaws of the Nemean Lion. See, said a Man, that's how strong we are! The King of Beasts is like wax in we hands! Ho!,laughed the Nemean Lion, a Man made a statue. It would have been quite a different scene had a Lion made It!"}
