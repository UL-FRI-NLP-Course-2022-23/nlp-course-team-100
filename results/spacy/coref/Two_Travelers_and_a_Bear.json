{"coref": "the Men were traveling in company through a forest, when, all at once, a huge Bear crashed out of the brush near the Men. One of the Men, thinking of a huge Bear own safety, climbed a tree. The other, unable to fight the savage beast alone, threw a huge Bear on the ground and lay still, as if a huge Bear were dead. a huge Bear had heard that a huge Bear a huge Bear will not touch a dead body. a Bear will not touch a dead body must have been true, for a huge Bear snuffed at the Man's head awhile, and then, seeming to be satisfied that a huge Bear was dead, walked away. The Man in a tree climbed down. It looked just as if that a huge Bear whispered in your ear, The Man in the tree said. What did The Man in the tree tell you? The Man in the tree said, answered the other, that it was not at all wise to keep company with a fellow who would desert The Man in the tree friend in a moment of danger."}
