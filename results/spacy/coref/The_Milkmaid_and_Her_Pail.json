{"coref": "A Milkmaid had been out to milk the cows and was returning from the field with the shining milk pail balanced nicely on A Milkmaid head. As A Milkmaid walked along, her head was busy with plans for the days to come. This good, rich milk, A Milkmaid mused, will give me plenty of cream to churn. The butter I make I will take to market, and with the money I get for market I will buy a lot of eggs for hatching. How nice it will be when The butter I make I will take to market, and with the money I get for it I will buy a lot of eggs for hatching are all hatched and the yard is full of fine young chicks. Then when May day comes I will sell The butter I make I will take to market, and with the money I get for it I will buy a lot of eggs for hatching, and with the money I'll buy a lovely new dress to wear to the fair. All the young men will look at me. All the young men will come and try to make love to me, but I shall very quickly send All the young men about All the young men business! As A Milkmaid thought of how A Milkmaid would settle that matter, A Milkmaid tossed her head scornfully, and down fell the pail of milk to the ground. And all the milk flowed out, and with all the milk vanished butter and eggs and chicks and new dress and all the milkmaid's pride."}
