{"coref": "There was once a Dog who was so ill-natured and mischievous that his Master had to fasten a heavy wooden clog about his neck to keep his from annoying visitors and neighbors. But the Dog seemed to be very proud of a heavy wooden clog about his neck and dragged the Dog about noisily as if the Dog wished to attract everybody's attention. the Dog was not able to impress anyone. You would be wiser, said an old acquaintance, to keep quietly out of sight with a heavy wooden clog about his neck. Do you want everybody to know what a disgraceful and ill-natured Dog you are?"}
