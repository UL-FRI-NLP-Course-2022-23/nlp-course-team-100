{"coref": "Why in the world do you walk sideways like that? said a Mother Crab to a Mother Crab son. You should always walk straight forward with your toes turned out. Show me how to walk, mother dear, answered a Mother Crab obediently, I want to learn. So a Mother Crab tried and tried to walk straight forward. But a Mother Crab could walk sideways only, like her son. And when a Mother Crab wanted to turn a Mother Crab toes out a Mother Crab tripped and fell on a Mother Crab nose."}
