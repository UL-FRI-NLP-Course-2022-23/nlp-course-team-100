{"coref": "There was once a Countryman who possessed the most wonderful Goose you can imagine, for every day when Countryman visited the nest, Goose had laid a beautiful, glittering, golden egg. a Countryman who possessed the most wonderful Goose you can imagine took the eggs to market and soon began to get rich. But it was not long before a Countryman who possessed the most wonderful Goose you can imagine grew impatient with Goose Goose because Goose gave a Countryman who possessed the most wonderful Goose you can imagine only a single golden egg a day. a Countryman who possessed the most wonderful Goose you can imagine was not getting rich fast enough. Then one day, after a Countryman who possessed the most wonderful Goose you can imagine had finished counting a Countryman who possessed the most wonderful Goose you can imagine money, the idea came to a Countryman who possessed the most wonderful Goose you can imagine that a Countryman who possessed the most wonderful Goose you can imagine could get all the golden eggs at once by killing Goose Goose and cutting Goose open. But when the deed was done, not a single golden egg did a Countryman who possessed the most wonderful Goose you can imagine find, and Goose Goose was dead."}
