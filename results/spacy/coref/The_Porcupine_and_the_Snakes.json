{"coref": "A Porcupine was looking for a good home. At last A Porcupine found a little sheltered cave, where lived a family of Snakes. A Porcupine asked a little sheltered cave, where lived a family of Snakes to let A Porcupine share a little sheltered cave, where lived a family of Snakes with a little sheltered cave, where lived a family of Snakes, and Snakes kindly consented. Snakes soon wished Snakes had not given A Porcupine permission to stay. A Porcupine sharp quills pricked Snakes at every turn, and at last Snakes politely asked A Porcupine to leave. I am very well satisfied, thank you, said A Porcupine. I intend to stay right here. And with that, A Porcupine politely escorted Snakes out of doors. And to save their skins, Snakes had to look for another home."}
