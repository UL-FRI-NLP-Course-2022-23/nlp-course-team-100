{"coref": "The Birds and the Beasts declared war against each other. No compromise was possible, and so The Birds and the Beasts went at No compromise tooth and claw. It is said the quarrel grew out of the persecution the race of Geese suffered at the teeth of the Fox family. the Beasts, too, had cause for fight. The Eagle was constantly pouncing on the Hare, and the Owl dined daily on Mice. It was a terrible battle. Many a the Hare and many a Mouse died. Chickens and Geese fell by the score--and the victor always stopped for a feast. Now the Fox family had not openly joined either side. the Fox family were a very politic race. So when the Fox family saw the Birds getting the better of the Birds, the Fox family were Birds for all there was in the Birds. But when the tide of battle turned, the Fox family immediately sided with the Beasts. When battle was over, the conduct of the Bats was discussed at the peace conference. Such deceit was unpardonable, and Birds and Beasts made common cause to drive out the Bats. And since then the Fox family hides in dark towers and deserted ruins, flying out only in the night."}
