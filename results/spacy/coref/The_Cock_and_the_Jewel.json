{"coref": "A Cock was busily scratching and scraping about to find something to eat for A Cock and A Cock family, when A Cock happened to turn up a precious jewel that had been lost by A Cock owner. Aha!, said A Cock, No doubt you are very costly and A Cock who lost you would give a great deal to find you. But as for A Cock, I would choose a single grain of barleycorn before all the jewels in the world."}
