{"coref": "the Merchant, came to a river crossed by a shallow ford. They had crossed a river crossed by a shallow ford many times before without accident, but this time Ass slipped and fell when halfway over. And when the Merchant at last got the Merchant to the Merchant feet, much of the salt had melted away. Delighted to find how much lighter the Merchant burden had become, Ass finished the journey very gayly. Next day the Merchant went for another load of salt. On the way home the Ass, remembering what had happened at a shallow ford, purposely let the Merchant fall into the water, and again got rid of most of the Merchant burden. the Merchant the Merchant immediately turned about and drove Ass back to the seashore, where the Merchant loaded Ass with two great baskets of sponges. At a shallow ford Ass again tumbled over; but when Ass had scrambled to his feet, his feet was a very disconsolate Ass that dragged Ass homeward under a load ten times heavier than before."}
