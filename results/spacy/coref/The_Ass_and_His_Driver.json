{"coref": "An Ass was being driven along a road leading down the mountain side, when An Ass suddenly took it into An Ass silly head to choose An Ass own path. An Ass could see An Ass stall at the foot of the mountain, and to An Ass the quickest way down seemed to be over the edge of the nearest cliff. Just as An Ass was about to leap over, An Ass master caught An Ass by the tail and tried to pull An Ass back, but An Ass An Ass would not yield and pulled with all An Ass might. Very well, said his master, go your way, you willful beast, and see where it leads you. With that his master let go, and An Ass An Ass tumbled head over heels down the mountain side."}
