{"coref": "A Wolf had been feasting too greedily, and a bone had stuck crosswise in A Wolf throat. A Wolf could get a bone neither up nor down, and of course A Wolf could not eat a thing. Naturally that was an awful state of affairs for a greedy A Wolf. So away A Wolf hurried to the Crane. A Wolf was sure that she, with she long neck and bill, would easily be able to reach a bone and pull a bone out. I will reward you very handsomely, said A WolfWolf, if you pull a bone out for A Wolf. the Crane, as you can imagine, was very uneasy about putting she head in A WolfA Wolf's throat. But she was grasping in nature, so she did what A Wolf Wolf asked she to do. When A Wolf Wolf felt that a bone was gone, A Wolf started to walk away. But what about my reward! called the Crane anxiously. What!, snarled A WolfWolf, whirling around. Haven't you got it? Isn't it enough that I let you take your head out of my mouth without snapping your head off?"}
