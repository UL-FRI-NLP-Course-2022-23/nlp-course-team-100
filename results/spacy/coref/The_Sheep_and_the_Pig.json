{"coref": "One day Shepherd discovered a fat Pig in the meadow where Shepherd Sheep were pastured. Shepherd very quickly captured the porker, which squealed at the top of a fat Pig voice the moment Shepherd laid Shepherd hands on a fat Pig. You would have thought, to hear the loud squealing, that a fat Pig was being cruelly hurt. But in spite of a fat Pig squeals and struggles to escape, Shepherd Shepherd tucked Shepherd prize under Shepherd arm and started off to the butcher's in the market place. The Sheep in the pasture were much astonished and amused at a fat Pig's behavior, and followed the Shepherd and Shepherd charge to the pasture gate. What makes you squeal like that? asked one of The Sheep in the pasture. Shepherd often catches and carries off one of us. But us should feel very much ashamed to make such a terrible fuss about it like you do. That is all very well, replied a fat Pig, with a squeal and a frantic kick. When Shepherd catches you Shepherd is only after your wool. But Shepherd wants my bacon! gree-ee-ee!"}
