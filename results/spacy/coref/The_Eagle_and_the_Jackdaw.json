{"coref": "An Eagle, swooping down on powerful wings, seized a lamb in a lamb talons and made off with a lamb to a lamb nest. A Jackdaw saw the deed, and A Jackdaw silly head was filled with the idea that A Jackdaw was big and strong enough to do as Eagle had done. So with much rustling of feathers and a fierce air, A Jackdaw came down swiftly on the back of a large Ram. But when A Jackdaw tried to rise again A Jackdaw found that A Jackdaw could not get away, for A Jackdaw claws were tangled in the wool. And so far was A Jackdaw from carrying away a large Ram, that a large Ram hardly noticed A Jackdaw was there. The Shepherd saw the fluttering A Jackdaw and at once guessed what had happened. Running up, The Shepherd caught the bird and clipped the bird wings. That evening The Shepherd gave A Jackdaw to The Shepherd children. What a funny bird this is! they said laughing, what do you call this, father? That is a Jackdaw, my children. But if you should ask father, father would say father is an Eagle."}
