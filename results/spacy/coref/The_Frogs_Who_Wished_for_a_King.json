{"coref": "The Frogs were tired of governing The Frogs. The Frogs had so much freedom that it had spoiled The Frogs, and The Frogs did nothing but sit around croaking in a bored manner and wishing for a government that could entertain The Frogs with the pomp and display of royalty, and rule The Frogs in a way to make The Frogs know The Frogs were being ruled. No milk and water government for The Frogs, The Frogs declared. So The Frogs sent a petition to Jupiter asking for a king. Jupiter saw what simple and foolish creatures Jupiter were, but to keep Jupiter quiet and make Jupiter think Jupiter had a king he threw down a huge log, which fell into the water with a great splash. The Frogs hid The Frogs among the reeds and grasses, thinking a king to be some fearful giant. But The Frogs soon discovered how tame and peaceable King Log was. In a short time The Frogs were using King Log for a diving platform, while The Frogs made King Log a meeting place, where The Frogs complained loudly to Jupiter about the government. To teach The Frogs a lesson the ruler of the gods now sent a Crane to be king of Frogland. a Crane a Crane proved to be a very different sort of king from old King Log. King Log gobbled up the poor Frogs right and left and they soon saw what fools they had been. In mournful croaks they begged Jupiter to take away the cruel tyrant before they should all be destroyed. How now!, cried Jupiter Are you not yet content? You have what you asked for and so you have only yourselves to blame for your misfortunes."}
