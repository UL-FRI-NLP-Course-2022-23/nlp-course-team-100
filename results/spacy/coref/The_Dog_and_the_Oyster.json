{"coref": "There was once a Dog who was very fond of eggs. a Dog who was very fond of eggs visited the hen house very often and at last got so greedy that a Dog who was very fond of eggs would swallow the eggs whole. One day a Dog who was very fond of eggs wandered down to the seashore, There a Dog who was very fond of eggs spied an Oyster. In a twinkling an Oyster was resting in a Dog who was very fond of eggs's stomach, shell and all. It pained a Dog who was very fond of eggs a good deal, as you can guess. I've learned that all round things are not eggs, a Dog who was very fond of eggs said groaning."}
