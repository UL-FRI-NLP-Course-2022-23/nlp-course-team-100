{"coref": "A Lion had been watching three Bullocks feeding in an open field. A Lion had tried to attack three Bullocks several times, but three Bullocks had kept together, and helped each other to drive A Lion off. A Lion Lion had little hope of eating three Bullocks, for A Lion was no match for three Bullocks with three Bullocks sharp horns and hoofs. But A Lion could not keep away from that field, for it is hard to resist watching a good meal, even when there is little chance of getting it. Then one day three Bullocks had a quarrel, and when A Lion A Lion came to look at three Bullocks and lick A Lion chops as A Lion was accustomed to do, A Lion found three Bullocks in separate corners of that field as far away from one another as three Bullocks could get. It was now an easy matter for A Lion A Lion to attack three Bullocks one at a time, and this A Lion proceeded to do with the greatest satisfaction and relish."}
