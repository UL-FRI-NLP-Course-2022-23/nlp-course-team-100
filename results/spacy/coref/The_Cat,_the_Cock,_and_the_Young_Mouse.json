{"coref": "A very young Mouse, who had never seen anything of the world, almost came to grief the very first time he ventured out. And this is the story he told he mother about he adventures. I was strolling along very peaceably when, just as I turned the corner into the next yard, I saw two strange creatures. One of two strange creatures had a very kind and gracious look, but the other was the most fearful monster you can imagine. You should have seen he, On top of he head and in front of he neck hung pieces of raw red meat. he walked about restlessly, tearing up the ground with he toes, and beating he arms savagely against he sides. The moment he caught sight of me he opened he pointed mouth as if to swallow me, and then he let out a piercing roar that frightened me almost to death. Can you guess who it was that our young Mouse was trying to describe to his mother? It was nobody but the Barnyard Cock and the first one the little Mouse had ever seen. If it had not been for that terrible monster, our young Mouse went on, I should have made the acquaintance of the pretty creature, who looked so good and gentle. our young Mouse had thick, velvety fur, a meek face, and a look that was very modest, though our young Mouse eyes were bright and shining. As our young Mouse looked at me our young Mouse waved our young Mouse fine long tail and smiled. I am sure our young Mouse was just about to speak to me when the monster I have told you about let out a screaming yell, and I ran for my life. My son, said the Mother Mouse, that gentle creature you saw was none other than the Cat. Under his kindly appearance, his bears a grudge against every one of us. The other was nothing but a bird who wouldn't harm you in the least. As for the Cat, his eats us. So be thankful, my child, that you escaped with your life, and, as long as you live, never judge people by people looks."}
