{"coref": "Away with you, vile insect!, said a Lion angrily to a Gnat that was buzzing around Lion head. But a Gnat was not in the least disturbed. Do you think, Lion said spitefully to Lion, that I am afraid of you because they call you king? The next instant Lion flew at Lion Lion and stung Lion sharply on the nose. Mad with rage, Lion Lion struck fiercely at a Gnat, but only succeeded in tearing Lion with Lion claws. Again and again a Gnat stung the Lion, who now was roaring terribly. At last, worn out with rage and covered with wounds that Lion own teeth and claws had made, Lion Lion gave up the fight. a Gnat buzzed away to tell the whole world about Lion victory, but instead Lion flew straight into a spider's web. And there, Lion who had defeated the King of beasts came to a miserable end, the prey of a little spider."}
