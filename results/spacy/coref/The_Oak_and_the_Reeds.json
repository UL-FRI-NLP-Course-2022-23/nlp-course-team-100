{"coref": "A Giant Oak stood near a brook in which grew some slender Reeds. When the wind blew, A Giant Oak stood proudly upright with A Giant Oak hundred arms uplifted to the sky. But some slender Reeds bowed low in the wind and sang a sad and mournful song. You have reason to complain, said A Giant Oak. The slightest breeze that ruffles the surface of the water makes you bow your heads, while I, the mighty Oak, stand upright and firm before the howling tempest. Do not worry about us, replied some slender Reeds. The winds do not harm us. us bow before them and so us do not break. You, in all your pride and strength, have so far resisted them blows. But the end is coming. As some slender Reeds spoke a great hurricane rushed out of the north. A Giant Oak stood proudly and fought against the storm, while some slender Reeds bowed low. the wind redoubled in fury, and all at once the great tree fell, torn up by the roots, and lay among some slender Reeds."}
