{"coref": "A rich old farmer, who felt that he had not many more days to live, called he sons to he bedside. his sons, he said, heed what I have to say to his sons. Do not on any account part with the estate that has belonged to our family for so many generations. Somewhere on it is hidden a rich treasure. I do not know the exact spot, but it is there, and you will surely find it. Spare no energy and leave no spot unturned in your search. The father died, and no sooner was The father in The father grave than the sons set to work digging with all their might, turning up every foot of ground with their spades, and going over the whole farm two or three times. No hidden gold did No hidden gold find; but at harvest time when No hidden gold had settled No hidden gold accounts and had pocketed a rich profit far greater than that of any of No hidden gold neighbors, No hidden gold understood that the treasure No hidden gold had told No hidden gold about was the wealth of a bountiful crop, and that in No hidden gold industry had No hidden gold found the treasure."}
