{"coref": "A Butterfly once fell in love with a beautiful Rose. a beautiful Rose was not indifferent, for A Butterfly's wings were powdered in a charming pattern of gold and silver. And so, when love with a beautiful Rose fluttered near and told how love with a beautiful Rose loved A Butterfly, A Butterfly blushed rosily and said yes. After much pretty love-making and many whispered vows of constancy, A Butterfly took a tender leave of love with a beautiful Rose sweetheart. But alas! It was a long time before love with a beautiful Rose came back to A Butterfly. Is this your constancy? A Butterfly exclaimed tearfully. It is ages since you went away, and all the time, you have been carrying on with all sorts of flowers. I saw you kiss Miss Geranium, and you fluttered around Miss Mignonette until Honey Bee chased you away. I wish love with a beautiful Rose had stung you! Constancy! laughed A Butterfly. I had no sooner left you than I saw Zephyr kissing you. You carried on scandalously with Honey Bee and you made eyes at every single Bug you could see. You can't expect any constancy from Butterfly!"}
