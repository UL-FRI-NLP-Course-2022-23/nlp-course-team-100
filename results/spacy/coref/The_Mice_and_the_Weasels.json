{"coref": "the Weasels the Mice were always up in arms against each other. In every battle the Weasels carried off the victory, as well as a large number of the Mice, which the Weasels ate for dinner next day. In despair the Mice called a council, and there the Mice was decided that the Mouse army was always beaten because the Mouse army had no leaders. So a large number of generals and commanders were appointed from among the most eminent Mice. To distinguish the most eminent Mice from the soldiers in the ranks, the new leaders proudly bound on the most eminent Mice heads lofty crests and ornaments of feathers or straw. Then after long preparation of the Mouse army in all the arts of war, the most eminent Mice sent a challenge to the Weasels. the Weasels accepted a challenge with eagerness, for the Weasels were always ready for a fight when a meal was in sight. the Weasels immediately attacked the Mouse army in large numbers. Soon the Mouse line gave way before the attack and the Mouse army fled for cover. The privates easily slipped into The privates holes, but no leaders could not squeeze through the narrow openings because of no leaders head-dresses. Not one escaped the teeth of the Weasels."}
