{"coref": "A Town Mouse once visited a relative who lived in the country. For lunch A Town Mouse served wheat stalks, roots, and acorns, with a dash of cold water for drink. A Town Mouse ate very sparingly, nibbling a little of this and a little of that, and by her manner making A Town Mouse very plain that her ate the simple food only to be polite. After the meal the friends had a long talk, or rather A Town Mouse talked about her life in the city while A Town Mouse listened. the friends then went to bed in a cozy nest in the hedgerow and slept in quiet and comfort until morning. In her sleep A Town Mouse dreamed her was a Town Mouse with all the luxuries and delights of city life that her friend had described for her. So the next day when A Town Mouse asked A Town Mouse to go home with her to the city, her gladly said yes. When the friends reached the mansion in which A Town Mouse lived, the friends found on the table in the dining room the leavings of a very fine banquet. There were sweetmeats and jellies, pastries, delicious cheeses, indeed, the most tempting foods that a Mouse can imagine. But just as A Town Mouse was about to nibble a dainty bit of pastry, just as the Country Mouse was about to nibble a dainty bit of pastry heard a Cat mew loudly and scratch at the door. In great fear the Mice scurried to a hiding place, where the Mice lay quite still for a long time, hardly daring to breathe. When at last the Mice ventured back to the feast, the door opened suddenly and in came the servants to clear the table, followed by the House Dog. A Town Mouse stopped in A Town Mouse's den only long enough to pick up just as the Country Mouse was about to nibble a dainty bit of pastry carpet bag and umbrella. You may have luxuries and dainties that I have not, just as the Country Mouse was about to nibble a dainty bit of pastry said as just as the Country Mouse was about to nibble a dainty bit of pastry hurried away, but I prefer my plain food and simple life in the country with the peace and security that go with it."}
