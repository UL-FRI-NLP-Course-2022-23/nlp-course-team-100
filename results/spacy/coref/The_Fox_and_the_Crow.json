{"coref": "One bright morning as the Fox was following Fox sharp nose through the wood in search of a bite to eat, Fox saw a Crow on the limb of a tree overhead. This was by no means the first a Crow had ever seen. What caught Fox attention this time and made Fox stop for a second look, was that a Crow a Crow held a bit of cheese in a Crow beak. No need to search any farther, thought sly Fox. Here is a dainty bite for my breakfast. Up Fox trotted to the foot of the tree in which a Crow a Crow was sitting, and looking up admiringly, Fox cried, Good-morning, beautiful creature! a Crow, a Crow head cocked on one side, watched the Fox Fox suspiciously. But a Crow kept her beak tightly closed on the cheese and did not return Fox greeting. What a charming creature a Crow is! said the Fox. How a Crow feathers shine! What a beautiful form and what splendid wings! Such a wonderful Bird should have a very lovely voice, since everything else about a Crow is so perfect. Could a Crow sing just one song, I know I should hail a Crow Queen of Birds. Listening to these flattering words, a Crow forgot all a Crow suspicion, and also a Crow breakfast. a Crow wanted very much to be called Queen of Birds. So a Crow opened her beak wide to utter a Crow loudest caw, and down fell the cheese straight into the Fox's open mouth. Thank you, said Fox sweetly, as Fox walked off Though it is cracked, you have a voice sure enough. But where are your wits?"}
