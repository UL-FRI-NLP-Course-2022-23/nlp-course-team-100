{"coref": "the greedy Dog, was hurrying home with the butcher prize as fast as the butcher could go. As the butcher crossed a narrow footbridge, the butcher happened to look down and saw the butcher reflected in the quiet water as if in a mirror. But the greedy Dog thought the butcher saw a real Dog carrying a bone much bigger than the butcher own. If the butcher had stopped to think the butcher would have known better. But instead of thinking, the butcher dropped a bone and sprang at the greedy Dog in the river, only to find the butcher swimming for dear life to reach the shore. At last the butcher managed to scramble out, and as the butcher stood sadly thinking about a bone, the butcher realized what a stupid the greedy Dog the butcher had been."}
