{"coref": "A pair of Oxen were drawing a heavily loaded wagon along a miry country road. A pair of Oxen had to use all A pair of Oxen strength to pull a heavily loaded wagon, but A pair of Oxen did not complain. The Wheels of a heavily loaded wagon were of a different sort. Though the task they had to do was very light compared with that of the Oxen, they creaked and groaned at every turn. the Oxen, pulling with all the Oxen might to draw a heavily loaded wagon through the deep mud, had the Oxen ears filled with the loud complaining of The Wheels of the wagon. And this, you may well know, made the Oxen work so much the harder to endure. Silence!, the Oxen cried at last, out of patience. What have The Wheels of the wagon to complain about so loudly? We are drawing all the weight, not you, and We are keeping still about The Wheels of the wagon besides."}
