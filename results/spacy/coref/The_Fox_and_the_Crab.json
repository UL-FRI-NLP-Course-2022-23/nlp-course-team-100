{"coref": "A Crab one day grew disgusted with the sands in which A Crab lived. A Crab decided to take a stroll to the meadow not far inland. There A Crab would find better fare than briny water and sand mites. So off A Crab crawled to the meadow. But there a hungry A Crab spied A Crab, and in a twinkling, ate A Crab up, both shell and claw."}
