{"coref": "A Fox, swimming across a river, was barely able to reach the bank, where A Fox lay bruised and exhausted from A Fox struggle with the swift current. Soon a swarm of blood-sucking flies settled on A Fox; but A Fox lay quietly, still too weak to run away from Soon a swarm of blood-sucking flies. A Hedgehog happened by. Let me drive blood-sucking flies away, A Fox said kindly. No, no! exclaimed A Fox, do not disturb Soon a swarm of blood-sucking flies! Soon a swarm of blood-sucking flies have taken all Soon a swarm of blood-sucking flies can hold. If you drive Soon a swarm of blood-sucking flies away, another greedy swarm will come and take the little blood I have left."}
