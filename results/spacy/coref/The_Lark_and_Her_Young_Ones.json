{"coref": "A Lark made A Lark nest in a field of young wheat. As the days passed, the wheat stalks grew tall and the young birds, too, grew in strength. Then one day, when the ripe golden grain waved in the breeze, the Farmer Farmer came into a field of young wheat. young wheat is now ready for reaping, said the Farmer. We must call in We neighbors and friends to help We harvest it. The young Larks in their nest close by were much frightened, for their knew their would be in great danger if their did not leave her nest before the reapers came. When A Lark returned with food for their, their told A Lark what their had heard. Do not be frightened, children, said A Lark. If the Farmer said the Farmer would call in the Farmer neighbors and friends to help the Farmer do the Farmer work, young wheat will not be reaped for a while yet. A few days later, young wheat was so ripe, that when the wind shook the stalks, a hail of wheat grains came rustling down on the young Larks' heads. If young wheat is not harvested at once, said the Farmer, we shall lose half the crop. We cannot wait any longer for help from We friends. Tomorrow We must set to work, We. When the young Larks told the young Larks mother what the young Larks had heard that day, A Lark said: Then We must be off at once. When a man decides to do a man own work and not depend on any one else, then you may be sure there will be no more delay. There was much fluttering and trying out of wings that afternoon, and at sunrise next day, when the Farmer and Farmer son cut down the grain, the Farmer and his son found an empty nest."}
