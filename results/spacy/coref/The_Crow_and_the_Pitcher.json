{"coref": "In a spell of dry weather, when the Birds could find very little to drink, a thirsty Crow found a pitcher with a little water in a thirsty Crow. But a pitcher with a little water in it was high and had a narrow neck, and no matter how a thirsty Crow tried, a thirsty Crow a thirsty Crow could not reach a little water in it. The poor thing felt as if a thirsty Crow must die of thirst. Then an idea came to a thirsty Crow. Picking up some small pebbles, a thirsty Crow dropped some small pebbles into a pitcher with a little water in it one by one. With each pebble a little water in it rose a little higher until at last a little water in it was near enough so a thirsty Crow could drink."}
