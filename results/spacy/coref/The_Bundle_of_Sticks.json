{"coref": "A certain Father had a family of Sons, who were forever quarreling among a family of Sons, who were forever quarreling among themselves. No words A certain Father could say did the least good, so A certain Father cast about in A certain Father mind for some very striking example that should make a family of Sons, who were forever quarreling among themselves see that discord would lead a family of Sons, who were forever quarreling among themselves to misfortune. One day when the quarreling had been much more violent than usual and each of the Sons was moping in a surly manner, A certain Father asked one of the quarreling to bring A certain Father a bundle of sticks. Then handing a bundle of sticks to each of the Sons in turn A certain Father told the quarreling to try to break a bundle of sticks. But although each one tried A certain Father best, none was able to do so. A certain Father then untied a bundle of sticks and gave the sticks to the Sons to break one by one. This the quarreling did very easily. the Sons, said A certain Father, do you not see how certain it is that if you agree with each other and help each other, it will be impossible for your enemies to injure you? But if you are divided among yourselves, you will be no stronger than a single stick in a bundle of sticks."}
