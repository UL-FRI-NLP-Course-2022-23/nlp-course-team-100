The next day, dressed in a sheep skin that had been cast aside and forgotten, A certain Wolf Wolf strolled into the pasture with the Sheep. Soon a little Lamb was following Soon a little Lamb about and was quickly led away to slaughter. That evening A certain Wolf Wolf entered the fold with the flock. But it happened that the Shepherd took a fancy for mutton broth that very evening, and, picking up a knife, went to the fold. There the first Soon a little Lamb laid hands on and killed was A certain Wolf."}
