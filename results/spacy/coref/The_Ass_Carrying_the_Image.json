{"coref": "A sacred Image was being carried to the temple. A sacred Image was mounted on an Ass adorned with garlands and gorgeous trappings, and a grand procession of priests and pages followed A sacred Image through the streets. As Ass walked along, the people bowed the people heads reverently or fell on the people knees, and Ass thought the honor was being paid to Ass. With Ass head full of this foolish idea, Ass became so puffed up with pride and vanity that Ass halted and started to bray loudly. But in the midst of Ass song, Ass driver guessed what Ass had got into his driver , and began to beat his driver unmercifully with a stick. Go along with you, you stupid Ass, his driver cried. the honor is not meant for you but for the image you are carrying."}
