{"coref": "Some hungry Dogs saw a number of hides at the bottom of a stream where the Tanner had put Some hungry Dogs to soak. A fine hide makes an excellent meal for a hungry Dog, but the water was deep and Some hungry Dogs could not reach the hides from the bank. So Some hungry Dogs held a council and decided that the very best thing to do was to drink up the river. All fell to lapping up the water as fast as Some hungry Dogs could. But though Some hungry Dogs drank and drank until, one after another, all of Some hungry Dogs had burst with drinking, still, for all all of them effort, the water in the river remained as high as ever."}
