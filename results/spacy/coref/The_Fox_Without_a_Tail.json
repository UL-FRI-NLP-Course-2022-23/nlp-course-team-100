{"coref": "A Fox that had been caught in a trap, succeeded at last, after much painful tugging, in getting away. But Fox had to leave Fox beautiful bushy tail behind Fox. For a long time Fox kept away from the other Foxes, for Fox knew well enough that they would all make fun of Fox and crack jokes and laugh behind Fox back. But it was hard for Fox to live alone, and at last Fox thought of a plan that would perhaps help Fox out of Fox trouble. Fox called a meeting of all the Foxes, saying that Fox had something of great importance to tell the tribe. When he had something of great importance to tell the tribe were all gathered together, the Fox Without a Tail got up and made a long speech about those Foxes who had come to harm because of he had something of great importance to tell the tribe tails. This one had been caught by hounds when This one had become entangled in the hedge. This one had not been able to run fast enough because of the weight of This one brush. Besides, it was well known, This one said, that men hunt Foxes simply for men tails, which men cut off as prizes of the hunt. With such proof of the danger and uselessness of having a tail, said Master Fox, Master Fox would advise every Master Fox to cut it off, if Master Fox valued life and safety. When Master Fox had finished talking, Master Fox Master Fox arose, and said, smiling: Master Fox, kindly turn around for a moment, and you shall have your answer. When the poor Master Fox Without a Tail turned around, there arose such a storm of jeers and hooting, that Master Fox saw how useless it was to try any longer to persuade the Foxes to part with the Foxes tails."}
