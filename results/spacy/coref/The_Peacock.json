{"coref": "The Peacock, The Peacock say, did not at first have the beautiful feathers in which The Peacock now takes so much pride. These, Juno, whose favorite The Peacock was, granted to The Peacock one day when The Peacock begged her for a train of feathers to distinguish The Peacock from the other birds. Then, decked in The Peacock finery, gleaming with emerald, gold, purple, and azure, The Peacock strutted proudly among the other birds. All regarded The Peacock with envy. Even the most beautiful pheasant could see that The Peacock beauty was surpassed. Presently The Peacock saw an Eagle soaring high up in the blue sky and felt a desire to fly, as The Peacock had been accustomed to do. Lifting The Peacock wings The Peacock tried to rise from the ground. But the weight of The Peacock magnificent train held The Peacock down. Instead of flying up to greet the first rays of the morning sun or to bathe in the rosy light among the floating clouds at sunset, The Peacock would have to walk the ground more encumbered and oppressed than any common barnyard fowl."}
