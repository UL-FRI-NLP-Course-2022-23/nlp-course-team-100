{"coref": "A pack of Wolves lurked near the Sheep pasture. But the Dogs kept them all at a respectful distance, and the Sheep grazed in perfect safety. But now Wolves thought of a plan to trick the Sheep. Why is there always this hostility between us? this hostility between us said. If it were not for those Dogs who are always stirring up trouble, I am sure us should get along beautifully. Send it were not for those Dogs who are always stirring up trouble away and you will see what good friends us shall become. the Sheep were easily fooled. the Sheep persuaded the Dogs to go away, and that very evening Wolves had the grandest feast of the Sheep lives."}
