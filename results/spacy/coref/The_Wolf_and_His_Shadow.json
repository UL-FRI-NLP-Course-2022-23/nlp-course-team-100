{"coref": "A Wolf left A Wolf lair one evening in fine spirits and an excellent appetite. As A Wolf ran, the setting sun cast A Wolf shadow far out on the ground, and his shadow looked as if A Wolf were a hundred times bigger than A Wolf really was. Why, exclaimed A Wolf A Wolf proudly, see how big I am! Fancy me running away from a puny Lion! I'll show A Wolf who is fit to be king, A Wolf or I. Just then an immense shadow blotted A Wolf out entirely, and the next instant a Lion struck A Wolf down with a single blow."}
