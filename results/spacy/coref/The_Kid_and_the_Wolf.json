{"coref": "A frisky young Kid had been left by the herdsman on the thatched roof of a sheep shelter to keep A frisky young Kid out of harm's way. A frisky young Kid was browsing near the edge of the thatched roof of a sheep shelter, when A frisky young Kid spied a Wolf and began to jeer at A frisky young Kid, making faces and abusing A frisky young Kid to A frisky young Kid heart's content. I hear you, said a Wolfa Wolf, and I haven't the least grudge against a Wolf for what you say or do. When you are up there it is the roof that's talking, not you."}
