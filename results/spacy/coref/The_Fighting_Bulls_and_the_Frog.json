{"coref": "Two Bulls were fighting furiously in a field, at one side of which was a marsh. An old Frog living in a marsh, trembled as An old Frog living in the marsh watched the fierce battle. What are you afraid of? asked An old Frog living in the marsh. Do you not see, replied the old Frog, that the Bull who is beaten, will be driven away from the good forage up there to the reeds of a marsh, and we shall all be trampled into the mud? It turned out as An old Frog living in the marsh An old Frog living in the marsh had said The beaten Bull was driven to the marsh, where Bull great hoofs crushed the Frogs to death."}
