{"coref": "The Ass, and a Fox were hunting in company, and caught a large quantity of game. The Ass was asked to divide the spoil. This The Ass did very fairly, giving each an equal share. a Fox a Fox was well satisfied, but The Ass flew into a great rage over The Ass, and with one stroke of The Ass huge paw, The Ass added The Ass to the pile of slain. Then The Ass turned to a Fox. You divide it, The Ass roared angrily. a Fox a Fox wasted no time in talking. a Fox quickly piled all the game into one great heap. From this a Fox took a very small portion for a Fox, such undesirable bits as the horns and hoofs of a mountain goat, and the end of an ox tail. The Ass now recovered The Ass good humor entirely. Who taught you to divide so fairly? The Ass asked pleasantly. I learned a lesson from The Ass, replied a Fox, carefully edging away."}
