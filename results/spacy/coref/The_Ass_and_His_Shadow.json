{"coref": "A Traveler had hired an Ass to carry an Ass to a distant part of the country. The owner of an Ass went with A Traveler, walking beside an Ass to drive an Ass and point out the way. The road led across a treeless plain where the Sun beat down fiercely. So intense did the heat become, that A Traveler A Traveler at last decided to stop for a rest, and as there was no other shade to be found, A Traveler A Traveler sat down in the shadow of an Ass. Now the heat had affected the Driver as much as the Driver had A Traveler, and even more, for the Driver had been walking. Wishing also to rest in the shade cast by an Ass, the Driver began to quarrel with A Traveler, saying the Driver had hired an Ass and not the shadow an Ass cast. The two soon came to blows, and while they were fighting, an Ass an Ass took to an Ass heels."}
