Every day A Miser went to the spot, dug up the treasure and counted the treasure piece by piece to make sure the treasure was all there. A Miser made so many trips that a Thief, who had been observing A Miser, guessed what it was A Miser had hidden, and one night quietly dug up the treasure and made off with it. When A Miser A Miser discovered A Miser loss, A Miser was overcome with grief and despair. A Miser groaned and cried and tore A Miser hair. A passerby heard A Miser cries and asked what had happened. My gold!, O my gold!, cried A Miser, wildly, someone has robbed me! Your gold!, There in that hole? Why did you put it there?, Why did you not keep it in the house where you could easily get it when you had to buy things? Buy! screamed A Miser angrily. Why, I never touched his gold. I couldn't think of spending any of it. The stranger picked up a large stone and threw a large stone into that hole. If that is the case, The stranger said, cover up a large stone. It is worth just as much to you as the treasure you lost!"}
