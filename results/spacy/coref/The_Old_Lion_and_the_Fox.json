{"coref": "An old Lion, whose teeth and claws were so worn that it was not so easy for him to get food as in him younger days, pretended that him was sick. him took care to let all him neighbors know about it, and then lay down in him cave to wait for visitors. And when they came to offer him they sympathy, him ate they up one by one. him came too, but him was very cautious about it. Standing at a safe distance from his cave, him inquired politely after the Lion's health. the Lion the Lion replied that the Lion was very ill indeed, and asked him to step in for a moment. But him very wisely stayed outside, thanking the Lion the Lion very kindly for the invitation. I should be glad to do as you ask, him added, but I have noticed that there are many footprints leading into his cave and none coming out. Pray tell me, how do your visitors find your visitors way out again?"}
