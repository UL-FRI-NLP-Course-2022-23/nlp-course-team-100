{"coref": "Some Boys were playing one day at the edge of a pond in which lived a family of Frogs. Some Boys amused Some Boys by throwing stones into the pond so as to make Some Boys skip on top of the water. stones were flying thick and fast and Some Boys were enjoying Some Boys very much; but the poor Frogs in the pond were trembling with fear. At last one of the Frogs, the oldest and bravest, put his head out of the water, and said, Oh, please, dear children, stop your cruel play! Though it may be fun for dear children, it means death to us!"}
